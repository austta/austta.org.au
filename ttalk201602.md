## **TOP TABLE TALK – V/LINE CRISIS**

The V/Line passenger network was in major disarray from the middle of
January.

The first indication was on 6 January 2016 with S. (Special Train
Notice) 16/6004 scheduling a special 6-car Vlocity trip from Southern
Cross to the Bombardier Siding at Dandenong for 11 January. Commencing
14 January, V/Line cancelled many services because of a sudden and
mysterious spate of wheel faults in its VLocity DMUs It was feared that
this could cause trains to derail. VLocities operate the majority of
V/Line services. About a quarter of the VLocity fleet was removed from
service for repair, forcing V/Line to scramble to patch together a
viable passenger service with replacement buses or by running shorter
trains. On 15 January V/Line issued at overnight notice, S.16/6022 for a
3-car VLocity trip to Craigieburn for lathe-work on the wheels to be
done on the Saturday afternoon, to return on Sunday “Accompanied by
Pilot ex Lathe*”.* Also issued on that day was S.16/6017, which
scheduled a similar trip for 2 VL sets from Southern Cross to the lathe
at Newport Workshops and S.16/6021 which scheduled another trip for
another VL set to Bombardier for Monday morning. On 16 January S.16/7018
cancelled 85 Vlocity-services per day, from 18 to 30 January.

The Transport Minister and V/Line managers held a “crisis” meeting on
Sunday 17th January.

The heavy wear and tear on train wheels was first identified in
December, but V/Line does not yet understand why it is happening, nor
how long it will take to fix the problem. Actually, it probably started
on the day the \$3.65 billion Regional Rail Link opened – 21-June-2015.

Experts from Monash University were recruited to help identify the
source of the costly damage to carriages, some of which have been in
service for only a few months. Wheel flanges are wearing away at an
unusually rapid rate, thinning out the wheel profile and creating the
risk that a train could derail if left unrepaired. One theory is that
tight curves on and near the North Melbourne flyover may be causing the
excessive wear. In fact, there is severely gouged rail on the sharp
curves leading to the flyover. In effect, if this track cannot be
currently used it would put the RRL tracks into platforms 1-8 out of use
(for VLocities in particular) unless rail lubrication or another
engineering solution can be found. Platforms 15 and 16 should be able to
handle eight trains per hour minimum if VLine got their act together.
The maximum number of VLocity arrivals from the RRL in the peak is about
11 per hour, and given that platforms 15/16 have extended lengths, all
VLocities could and should be directed there. The long term solution is
perhaps to realign the RRL tracks from Spion Kop to the up side of the
flyover, ie, a substantial rebuild. There are also gouged rails at
Sunshine and, to a lesser extent at Deer Park Junction.

V/Line chief executive Theo Taifalos said he had made the call to put
the VLocity trains out of service, in the full knowledge this would
disrupt many passengers. ”Ï won't let safety be compromised, so I made
the decision to pull the carriages out of service," he said.

The wear and tear is also evident on V/Line's older diesel carriages,
but is not so serious that trains must be removed from service. Mr
Taifalos said the problem had emerged only in the past 30 days. He said
there was no prospect of pulling the entire VLocity fleet out of
service.

Paul Westcott, regional spokesman for the Public Transport Users
Association, said passengers would be frustrated but had to take it on
good faith that V/Line had made the correct call. He said it was
fortunate the problem emerged during mid-summer when many people were
away.

By Friday 15 January, half of the VLocity fleet was out of service.
During Friday, in a probably unrelated incident, a VLocity failed to
trigger a level crossing near Dandenong. Metro Trains then banned
VLocities on its tracks. According to V/Line’s website, Seymour trains
were operating - presumably with Sprinter DMUs. However, Bendigo trains
only operated between Bendigo and Sunbury. V/Line passengers had to make
their own way to Sunbury on Metro suburban trains. Similarly, Gippsland
trains only operated east of Pakenham, and passengers had to make their
own there on Metro trains.

On Saturday afternoon 16 January V/Line issued a circular cancelling a
large number of trains on the Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo lines, and
to a lesser extent, the Traralgon line, on weekdays. This is to apply
until the end of January. Large-scale bus replacements were arranged at
short notice. V/Line trains were withdrawn from their hire to Metro
Trains for the Frankston-Stony Point line for use elsewhere on the
V/Line system. Cancellations varied from time to time, but the following
are the trains (all VLocities) that were generally cancelled and
replaced by buses:

0625 Southern Cross-Wyndham Vale<br />
0649 SC-Wyndham Vale<br />

0507 Bendigo-SC<br />
0622 Eaglehawk-SC<br />
0721 Kyneton-SC<br />
2038 Bendigo-SC

All Gippsland line services - except that Bairnsdale trains, 0527
Traralgon-SC, 0637 Traralgon-SC, 1658 SC-Traralgon and 1737 SC-Traralgon
are still trains. Metro Trains reportedly would not agree to a plan by
V/Line for V/Line trains to operate east of Pakenham, with passengers
transferring to Metro Trains at Pakenham.

In addition, the appropriate empty trains associated with the above were
cancelled. Also, some other trains operated with reduced formations.
Consequently, the 1744 and 1830 Southern Cross-Waurn Ponds are operating
with “Banker Road Coaches” – this is phrase inherited from Victorian
Railways days meaning supplementary buses.

V/Line issued S circulars on a day-to-day basis confirming or varying
some of the above list.

On 18 January the Minister issued an unusually strongly worded
statement. She said she had been advised of V/Line’s failure to
adequately prepare for increased regional services – including a failure
to plan for additional track‐greasing – which has led to an escalated
rate of wearing on the wheels of VLocity carriages. This lack of
preparation has led to the cancellation of train services across the
network – an unacceptable and avoidable situation that has frustrated
thousands of regional commuters. She said these issues are being
addressed through additional maintenance and the replacement of wheels,
and that services will progressively resume over the coming week. On the
separate issue of a boom gate activation failure, restrictions imposed
by Metro had now been lifted on the Bendigo and Seymour lines. This
freed up additional non‐VLocity carriages to run on the Gippsland line,
while testing on the VLocity fleet continues to allow the Gippsland line
restrictions to be lifted. These restrictions were expected to be lifted
by late January. The Government instructed PTV to accelerate the rollout
of axle counters across metropolitan lines used by V/Line services
facilitate safety at level crossings, at a cost of \$23 million on axle
counters to. These will take three to six months to install.

To compensate for the mess, free travel was provided on V/Line from 23
until 31 January. On 28 January, this was extended for a further week
until 7 February. Towards the end of January, as some VLocities were
fitted with newly ordered wheels, some of the cancelled trains were
restored. But now, the free travel caused a significant increase in
patronage. So, there was still a need for a large number of replacement
buses.

One question not covered anywhere on any V/Line, PT&gt; or Government
website is the question of first class travel in loco-hauled
long-distance trains. Enquiries at Geelong RS elicited the following
information: The first people to book on any specific long-distance
train are placed in the ACN (first class) car and when that is filled,
the BN, BRN, etc (economy cars) are utilised. The irony of this is that
because of heavy bookings in the ACN, the first class car changes from
being the quietest and most commodious car on the train to being the
noisiest and busiest.

On 27 January, Theo Taifalos, the chief executive of V/Line, resigned.
Public Transport Minister Jacinta Allan said she was furious about the
wheel wear problems. She said the current disruptions were “totally
unacceptable. V/Line passengers are furious – and so is the Government.
What has happened is not good enough. On behalf of the Government I
apologise for the disruption and the inconvenience it has, and will
continue to, cause.” She said she had been given false advice in the
preceding week that a solution to the issue was imminent and that
services would begin to return to normal by the end of the following
week. ”I was given inconsistent and unreliable advice on that issue,"
she said.

The Minister announced that Gary Liddle will be the interim CEO of
V/Line. He is currently CEO of Public Transport Victoria and is the
former CEO of VicRoads. He will be an experienced and steady hand to
guide V/Line through this difficult period.

After the boom-gate fault at a level crossing near Dandenong, the
National Safety Regulator advised that safety measures must be carried
out on all 21 affected crossings on the Pakenham line. While this work
is undertaken VLocity trains cannot run between Traralgon and Melbourne
and will be replaced by buses. The Government is investigating using
other train models to boost services. This aspect of the disruption is
expected to continue for at least six weeks.

The Government has ordered a review of V/Line operations, and the
technical investigations into the wheel wear and boom-gate issues are
continuing. A Cabinet Committee will be overseeing this issue until it
is resolved.

It will be months before normal services resume in full.

At this point, the story was dominating Victorian news media. Despite
the Minister very publicly blasting part of her own portfolio, the
large, front-page headline in Australia’s biggest selling daily
newspaper, the *Herald Sun*, on 29 January was “Minister, You are
Next!”. The *Age*’s main front page headline was “Dangerous curves”
above a picture of a VLocity on the sharply curved tracks of the North
Melbourne flyover.

The planned V/Line timetable upgrade, due to start on 31 January has
been deferred until further notice. Ms Allan said she did not have
confidence the change would go smoothly given V/Line's deep problems.
(Details of the now deferred timetable were in January *Table Talk*,
pages 4-5), The main alteration was to have been one extra train each
way to/from Bendigo – Ms Allan’s electorate. Deferred are:

-   Bendigo line upgrades
-   Ballarat and Geelong lines minor changes
-   Gisborne – Gisborne station bus routes 473 and 474
-   Swan Hill – Tooleybuc via Nyah West bus, and
-   Cowes – Wonthaggi via Anderson bus.

Still going ahead on 31 January/1 February are timetable changes for the
Wyndham, Geelong and Lara bus networks.

# **RAIL AND TRAM NEWS**

**Aurizon freight**

The good news: Aurizon has signed a two-year contract with Syntech
Resources for the haulage of coal from the Cameby Downs mine to the port
of Brisbane. It will see Aurizon haul up to 1.7 million tonnes per annum
of coal from 1 February 2016, and includes the option of an additional
two-year extension. It replaces an existing 1.4mtpa agreement that
commenced in 2011 and will expire at the end of January.

Aurizon has signed a two-year agreement with Wilmar Sugar to haul
approximately 245,000 tonnes per annum of bulk sugar from the Proserpine
Mill to Queensland Sugar Ltd at Mackay Harbour and 60,000 tonnes of
molasses from the Burdekin mills to Port of Townsville from January
2016. The new agreement is in addition to the existing 1.2 million
tonnes of bulk sugar contract Aurizon has with Wilmar in North
Queensland’s Burdekin region.

The Townsville-Mt Isa line re-opened on 12 January, following building
of a deviation around the site of a large derailment of wagons carrying
sulfuric acid on 27 December.

The bad news: On 18 January Clive Palmer’s Queensland Nickel at
Townsville went into receivership. Its biggest debt is \$20 million to
Aurizon.

Aurizon has announced 480 job cuts in Queensland, because of the
downturn in the resources, especially coal, sector.

**Genesee & Wyoming freight**

The good news: G&W has signed a contract with Cu-River Mining for the
haulage of iron ore from Rankin Dam (near Coober Pedy) to Outer Harbor.
Up to six trains a week will operate from February/March.

The bad news: With the worldwide downturn in iron ore prices, traffic
ceased from Wirrida to Whyalla, SA and from Mukaty to Darwin, NT, late
last year.

**Pacific National freight**

Pacific National will make 65 drivers redundant because of the downturn
in the coal sector – 45 in the Hunter Valley, 10 at Werris Creek and 10
at Port Kembla.

**Trams for Brisbane?**

Labor’s Brisbane Lord Mayoral candidate Rod Harding has announced that
he was investigating light rail as part of his plan to tackle Brisbane
traffic congestion. He said no final decision had been made on a so-far
un-costed project but he believed light rail would help “energise”
Brisbane while “driving a new public transport culture in our city”.

**Newcastle Trams**

On 21 January the NSW Department of Transport invited expressions of
interest for contracts to design and construct the light rail line in
Newcastle from the existing heavy rail station at Wickham with Pacific
Park in the Newcastle city centre. The closing date is 12 February with
the infrastructure contract due to be awarded in mid-2016. Costings and
funding options have yet to be confirmed.

The Labor Party would not reinstall the heavy rail line to Newcastle
station if it was voted in at the next state election, Lake Macquarie MP
and then Shadow Minister for the Hunter Jodie Harrison said. “The fight
has been lost” to keep heavy rail into the city, and the party was
focusing its attention on making sure the state government followed
through on it commitments on light rail. There is no point spending our
time and energy on trying to achieve something that we actually can’t
do. The rail is gone, and we need to make sure we get the best outcome
for Newcastle now,” she said.

**Sydney Trams**

A surge in passengers on Sydney's inner-west light rail line over the
past year has prompted the provision of up to 90 extra services a week
to cope with demand during peak travel periods. The number of passengers
using the trams rose almost 60% to 6.1 million last financial year due
in large part to the opening of the 5.6-km extension to Dulwich Hill in
early 2014, government figures show. The patronage statistics will not
be a surprise to commuters who are increasingly finding carriages
packed. Most of the extra peak-hour services will begin from Monday 25
January, while the remainder will be put on by the middle of the year.
In total, tram services will rise from 197 to 215 on weekdays. This will
result in services every eight minutes during peak travel periods on
weekdays, instead of every 10 minutes at present. The afternoon peak
travel period will be extended by an hour to 1900 on weekdays, with a
service every 10 minutes.

**Sydney Trains: Working Timetable 6 March**

A Working Timetable, Books 1 (weekdays) and 2 (weekends), will be take
effect from Sunday 6 March 2016 - Version 5.15. A number of changes to
the content and format have been incorporated:

* Passenger time alterations for the majority of South Coast services
* Altered train numbering, stabling arrangements, and revised train
rosters for some South Coast services
* Additional dividing service in the afternoon at Wollongong
* Improved platform consistency on the single line sections between
Kiama and Wollongong
* Increased use of “clock face” operating patterns on the South Coast
line
* Oscars on South Coast will run to high speed signs
* Revised sectional running times on South Coast resulting in minor
alterations
* Guards will be located in the 5th position compartment for the entire
journey on South Coast, and
* Mechanised Track Patrol has been extended to Nowra.


**Sydney Trains: Network Rules and Procedures**

A new amendment pack for the Network Rules & Network Procedures has been
issued. The amendments include:

* Aspects that have proven to provide a safety benefit
* Improvements to work on track documentation
* Removal or update of obsolete references e.g. RailCorp
* Restructuring of the documents to re-order content to improve
readability
* Assigning specific tasks to the correct role and updating roles post
reform name changes
* Where possible, information that was regularly published.

**Transport for NSW: Epping -Thornleigh third track**

The overhead electrification over the new down relief line from Epping
to Thornleigh (6 km) is expected to be energised from 14 February. The
new line will come into operation soon. It is expected to facilitate, in
particular, down freight train working on the heavy grades in this area.

**Travelling to Sydney? Sharpen your bureaucratic skills**

From 1 January 2016 paper tickets for Pensioners and Seniors were
abolished in the Greater Sydney area, and replaced by electronic Opal
cards. As per the Australia-wide intergovernmental agreement, non-NSW
Pensioners and Seniors remain eligible for concession travel. However,
the procedure has been made unbelievably complex and bureaucratic. It
seems to be designed to discourage applications.

Interstate Pensioners may obtain an Opal card as simply as NSW people.
However, interstate Seniors cardholders are required to download a form
from the Transport for NSW website, fill in their personal details, copy
both sides of their concession card, and submit all of this by email or
post to Transport for NSW. The application may not be submitted more
than two weeks before the Opal card is required. The Opal card must be
topped up on arrival in Sydney. The Opal card is then only valid for 60
days – after which time your credit is lost, or has to be specially
applied for. After 60 days, a new application (including copies, back
and front, of the concession card) must be submitted and the process
repeated.

In late January, there was a backlog of applications. As a trial, 30 day
Opal cards were supplied to Central station which were provided upon
application and presentation of a valid Seniors card – but not at the
Airport stations or anywhere else.

**Metro Trains Melbourne: Public timetables**

A full set of Metro Train public timetable booklets was re-issued from 1
January 2016, The main change is the inclusion of all-night trains on
Friday and Saturday nights. They now have bright illustrations on the
front cover, unique to each booklet, as follows, although sometimes the
connection seems tenuous:

Werribee & Williamstown: Sailing boat<br />
Sunbury: Asian soup bowl<br />
Craigieburn & Upfield: Koala (for the zoo)<br />
Sandringham: Beach changing hut<br />
Pakenham & Cranbourne: Flower & bowl (for markets?)<br />
Frankston: Pelican<br />
Glen Waverley: Croissant on dish<br />
Belgrave & Lilydale: Cockatoo, plus Puffing Billy\<br />
Alamein Possum<br />
Hurstbridge: Rowing boat<br />
South Morang: Shopping bag.

**Portland-Hamilton minerals trains**

The new freight trains between Portland and Iluka Siding (7 km south of
Hamilton), Victoria, that commenced in January (mentioned in January
*Table Talk* page 2) transport mineral sands from Ceduna, SA. The sand
is shipped to Portland, railed to the Iluka plant for refining, then
trucked (not railed) back to Portland for export. The refinery also
processes mineral sands from northern Victoria, railed from Hopetoun.

**South Gippsland Railway closes**

The membership of the South Gippsland Railways has voted to close the
tourist railway after 21 years of operation. Passenger services had
ceased in late November due to safety issues, although this was
reportedly only part of a much bigger problem, which included an
"unsustainable" number of active volunteers and insufficient financial
resources to maintain the railway's infrastructure and rollingstock, as
well as a struggle with vandalism and theft.

**Comment**: Once there seemed to be railfan railways and museums every
few kilometres. Gradually, one by one, most have closed for various
reasons and there are now few left. The great metropolis of Sydney has,
in effect, got very little. Most of the survivors that still operate
regularly are in Victoria. These are Puffing Billy (Melbourne),
Mornington, Daylesford, Castlemaine, Walhalla (infrequent), Bellarine
Peninsula. Elsewhere, operating survivors are: Steam Ranger (SA South
Coast), Pichi Richi (SA north), Hotham Valley (WA), Pemberton (SW WA),
Don River (NW Tasmania - very short length.), West Coast (Tasmania -
remote), Canberra (infrequent), Thirlmere (NSW) and Rosewood (SE Qld -
infrequent).

**Adelaide Metro**

**Timetable changes 26 January:** A major change took take place on the
Glenelg tram line with the withdrawal of the City Shuttle between West
Terrace and South Terrace. All trams now travel the full route from the
Entertainment Centre to Glenelg thus overcoming the problem of
passengers inadvertently catching a shuttle tram. This will improve
services over the whole line to a ten minute headway. However, there is
a reduction in service through the CBD from the former 7/8 headway
there.

**Extension Tonsley to Flinders**: On 20 December the SA and Federal
Governments announced “ïn principle agreement” to extend the Tonsley
branch 700 metres to Flinders University and Medical Centre. At a cost
of \$85 million, this will take two years to complete.

**New Year’s Eve:** Additional services operated (except on the Tonsley
line) with free travel between 1800 and dawn. (In previous years free
travel was only provided after midnight.) Details were available on the
website but no printed material was available. The main centres of the
celebrations affecting public transport were at Elder Park in the City
and the foreshore at Glenelg. The Glenelg tram line was truncated at
Brighton Road stop 15 as in previous years from 1800 to about 0400. In
addition a supplementary bus service was scheduled between the City
(North Terrace) and Glenelg from 2000 to 0500. In many cases buses
operated on an hourly service up to about 0300-0400 depending on the
routes.

**Reduced services 29, 30 and 31 December:** Details were posted on the
website but no printed matter was available. In a number of cases a
modified Saturday service was operated.

**Trains slower than 25 years ago:** The Liberal Opposition claims that
a comparison with the 1988-9 timetable shows that travel times on the
Outer Harbor, Noarlunga and Gawler lines have increased by three
minutes, and by one minute on the Belair line.

**TranzScenic**

Departures and arrivals of KiwiRail’s Northern Explorer thrice-weekly
Auckland-Wellington passenger train moved from Auckland Britomart
station (the central station used by suburban trains) to Auckland Strand
station (the old main station), about 3 km away, from Monday 21 December
(as foreshadowed in January *Table Talk* page 6).

**Auckland City centre tunnel**

NZ Prime Minister John Key said on 27 January that strong growth in rail
patronage warrants an early start for the \$NZ 2.5 billion Auckland City
Rail Link, the proposed 3.4 km underground link from Britomart, through
the CBD to the Western line at Mt Eden.

“A couple of years ago, I said the Government was committed to a joint
business plan for the Rail Link with Auckland Council in 2017,” he said.
“We agreed to provide a share of funding for construction to start in
2020, and we were prepared to consider an earlier start if Auckland’s
rail patronage and CBD employment hit certain thresholds committed to by
the Auckland Council. While CBD employment levels are still some way
from the 25% growth threshold, strong growth in rail patronage since
2013 means it will reach the 20 million annual trip threshold well
before 2020. It’s become clear that we need to provide certainty for
other planned CBD developments affected by the Rail Link. This means we
see merit in starting the project sooner.” A funding commitment from
2020 may allow work to start in 2018, at least two years earlier than
planned.

# **ODD SPOT**

Is this the worst excuse yet for late trains? On 12 January Southeastern
trains of Britain tweeted “Apologies we are having issues dispatching
trains due to the strong sunshine this morning”. Drivers were, it was
said, required to leave their cabs and physically check the platforms as
they were unable to view the monitors, delaying trains.

Jordan Cox travelled between Sheffield and his home in Essex by flying
via Berlin because it was cheaper than taking the train. He also found
similar anomalies for travelling London to Bristol via Dublin,
London-Manchester via Milan and Bristol-Newcastle via Dublin. The

Singapore Airlines will increase its flights from Brisbane from 21 to 24
weekly from late May.

New Chinese airlines servicing Sydney Airport are **Xiamen Airlines**
with flights to Fuzhou thrice weekly from 30 November, and twice weekly
to Xiamen; and **Hainan Airlines** to Xian twice weekly from 24
December. This is in addition to Air China, China Eastern, China

**Airly – will it fly?**

A company called **Airly** is proposing a high quality air service
between Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. It proposes to be membership
based. Members will pay a \$1000 joining fee and a \$2550 monthly fee
for effectively unlimited flights between Sydney (Bankstown Airport),
Melbourne (Essendon Airport) and Canberra on an eight-seater King Air
350 turboprop. It will offer an initial 54 flights a week, with plans to
expand to Adelaide and Brisbane at a later date. The majority of the
start-up funds will be raised from the \$1000 joining fees, with the
remainder coming from the founders and potential "angel" sources. Airly,
which won't own the aircraft, calls itself a "sales and experience
service" rather than an airline. The first of three King Air 350s has
already been ordered from the US through an aircraft management company.
They will be added to the air operator's certificate of an Australian
company licensed for regular public transport and then leased.

Essendon Airport is closer to the Melbourne central business district
than Tullamarine, but in Sydney, Bankstown Airport is farther from the
CBD than Kingsford-Smith. Canberra was added to the initial destination
list after the Airly founders discovered how expensive last-minute
flights to/from Canberra were from those markets, as well as the more
limited schedule of the commercial airlines. In the air, the company
hopes there will be a club atmosphere where like-minded executives are
able to chat.

In California, Surf Air, which launched in early 2013 has more than 1000
members, has raised a \$US65 million and expanded its list of
destinations now its business model has been proven. On the US east
coast [a new company called Beacon](https://flybeacon.com/) proposes to
offer similar flights between New York and Boston.

# **FERRY NEWS**

Demand for **Sydney Ferries** on Sundays to destinations such as Taronga
Zoo and stops along the Parramatta River has risen substantially since
the \$2.50 Opal card limit was introduced several years ago. In
response, the state's pricing regulator wants to increase ferry fares on
Sunday to spread the demand. Many ferry services now experience their
peak loads for the week on Sundays as travellers delay their trips to
take advantage of the cheaper fares. Transport for NSW has told the
state's pricing regulator that Harbour City Ferries is receiving
"substantial amounts" to provide extra services on Sundays to cope with
the demand. The Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal believes the
\$2.50 cap on the cost of public transport on Sundays is "too low",
especially for ferries, and is a key reason for the spike in demand on
Sundays.

Outbound ferries from central Sydney to stops in the eastern suburbs and
along the Parramatta River operated at more than 100% of their maximum
capacity on Sundays in May last year when a count was carried out by the
Bureau of Transport Statistics.

The NSW Government awarded Harbour City Ferries – a consortium of
ASX-listed Broadspectrum (formerly Transfield Services) and
multinational Transdev – an \$800 million contract in 2012 to operate
Sydney Ferries for seven years.

**Adelaide Metro timetable changes 26 January:** Many of the bus
timetables changed with some route changes, as well as fine-tuning to
times. Having a major change effective from a mid-week public holiday is
unusual. In reality the changes will take place from the following day –
Wednesday 27 January.

## **Tasmania**
*by Ian Cooper*

**Metro Hobart:** The proposed extension of services 614, 615 and 616 to
Anchorage Circuit in Tranmere did not take place as planned. Field
inspections revealed that there were no suitable roadways upon which a
bus could be turned around.

The new timetables to Howrah and Tranmere (routes 614, 615 and 616) have
created considerable puzzlement in some circles. Services to these
suburbs operate in one direction only - on Saturdays and Sundays one
side of the new timetable covers all departures for Tranmere via Howrah
from the Hobart City Interchange. On Monday to Friday this service
comprises routes 614, 615, 616, X15 and X16. However, on Saturday and
Sunday departures from the City constitute buses on route 616 only with
all buses travelling via Oceana Drive. Yes, that is correct – there is
no service on route 616 to Hobart City. In Southern Howrah and Tranmere
prospective passengers must walk to Howrah or Tranmere Roads and catch a
Route 615 bus for which there is no service from Hobart City to Tranmere
at Weekends. The flip side of the timetable on Saturday and Sunday
includes the timetable for route 615 only with all buses travelling via
Tranmere and Howrah Roads.

One could think that the new service has the prospects of becoming a
loop route operating through the terminus at Oceana Drive, Tranmere.
However, at present a bus on route 616 travels to the terminus and,
after a layover of 27 minutes, becomes a route 615 back to the city via
Tranmere and Howrah Roads. Hardly an inducement to encouraging residents
to encourage residents to travel at weekends by bus. The reverse
operation requires a similar changeover at the Tranmere terminus but the
wait is only 12 minutes. But then again this correspondent believes that
most drivers would not like the prospect of providing accommodation for
waiting passengers on board the bus at the terminus for either 12 or 27
minutes.

Although some students of Hobart bus services are aware that Metro has
attempted to spread, too thinly, its meagre resources over one “old”
route (the 615) and one “new route” (the 616), one must contemplate that
the continued operation of the 615 only may have been a more practical
operation for the immediate future.

Metro has failed dismally to provide information to prospective
passengers as to how one can use two “one-way” bus routes on the Eastern
Shore. Treatment of information at bus stops, while accurate, does
little to assist passengers. At those stops to the south of Shoreline,
references under the Timetable for Saturday and Sunday simply states “No
Service”. There is no reference to the existence of other services, even
if access to the opposing service may require a walk of one or two
kilometres.

**Extra SkyBus stop at Melbourne Airport**

In addition to the new undercover ‘transport hub’ constructed for the
expanded T4 building, serving local buses and the SmartBus 901, a
separate SkyBus stop opened in front of T4 for inbound services on
29 November, including a third staffed ticket counter.

Services now originate outside the T4 building as of 29 November after
laying-over. Buses are timetabled to depart T4, then T3 four minutes
later, and T1 eight minutes after T4. Previously buses departed T3 5
minutes before T1. Trips arriving the Airport continue to set down at T3
& T1 only.

Daily V/Line services to Barham (connecting to Barmah) and
Echuca/Deliquin along with shuttle buses to outer suburbs and regional
areas continue to depart from the existing bays between T1 & T2.

**New Uni shuttles for 2016**

Three new express shuttle services promised by the Victorian Government
will start with the 2016 academic year.

-   201 – between Deakin Uni & Box Hill, in addition to existing 281,
    767 & 768
-   301 – between La Trobe Uni and Reservoir, in addition to existing
    561
-   403 – offpeak shuttle between Melbourne Uni & Footscray, in addition
    to existing 402 (and 401 shuttle to North Melbourne)

201 will be operated Ventura, Dysons Subsidiary East-West will run the
301 and Sita has won the 403 contract. A modified PTV livery will be
worn on the buses, with large route numbers on the side similar to what
vehicles operating 401 and 601 wear.

**Concise information goes on holiday**

A range of issues presented themselves to those wishing to catch a bus
during the festive period, thanks to continual misinformation on the PTV
website.

With Coles closed on Christmas Day, the poorly utilised East-West 560
between Pascoe Vale and Coburg North Village didn’t run, despite notes
on stop timetables that it would operate a Sunday timetable.

Boxing Day fell on a Saturday this year, creating a new set of oddities.
Most metropolitan operators treated it as a regular Saturday, with
6-day-a-week routes at CDCM, Cranbourne Transit, Dysons, East West &
Moreland all running as normal, as did those routes at Ventura’s Ivanhoe
and Lilydale depots, which normally don’t run public holidays. The PTV
website however failed to display times for over two-dozen routes
operating. Tullamarine Bus Lines failed to operate the 490, while Moonee
Valley did not provide buses on 503 or 506. CDCM ran late night trips on
170, 180, 494 & 495, however these also failed to display online or on
apps.

Regionally, buses in Ballarat and Geelong ran to a normal Saturday
timetable and in most other towns ran to a Sunday timetable or no
service, depending on what normally operates on public holidays.
McKenzies advised that their Elidon 684 service would run a normal
Saturday timetable but the PTV website timetable showed the public
holiday timetable, no doubt stranding people given the low frequency of
services and vast differences between the two.

Operators treated the Boxing Day holiday on Monday 28 December as a
standard public holiday, as they also did for New Year’s Day. This meant
that many 6-day-a-week services failed to run, however a poor choice of
words by PTV suggested otherwise. Your *Bus News* correspondent
suggested to PTV that *‘All services will operate to a normal Saturday
timetable, however some routes may have alterations’* was a very poor
convoluted way of saying selected routes wouldn’t run, but they refused
to change the word ‘all’ to ‘most’. Their information also failed to
suggest that selected routes would conclude at different times than
normal due to late night services not running. In case of 896, the late
night “Cranbourne NightLife Shuttle” trips were incorrectly shown as
operating.

For New Year’s Eve, Transdev operated all night services on DART routes
905, 906, 907 & 908 for a second year, however unlike in 2014, no
inbound trips were rostered. Extra shuttle buses also operated to/from
Doncaster Park+Ride. PTV failed to show the timetable online, although
PDFs were provided on the Transdev website. Customers travelling from
Doncaster Park+Ride were incorrectly advised on a handwritten notice
services would depart every 50 mins, when services ran every half-hour
until 0230 then dropped to hourly.

New Year’s Eve also saw the introduction of the new Night Network
services across Melbourne, however Night Coach did not start to the
following night, possibly as PTV was unable to forecast loadings.

Bus operators ran their standard (but complex!) public holiday timetable
patterns on Australia Day.

To cater for summer loadings on the Mornington Peninsula, buses on 788
(Frankston – Portsea) once ran a 45 – 50 min weekend frequency from
Boxing Day 26 December to Australia Day 26 January. Last year 788
incorrectly ran to the standard Saturday timetable on Australia Day,
leaving your bus news correspondent stranded in Rye for almost an hour,
and then late to a traditional BBQ lunch.

CDCM ran their reduced peak timetable on 605 (City – Gardenvale) from 29
December until 22 January, however PTV initially showed the dates
incorrectly as 20 December until 15 January. The latter set of dates
were also wrongly used for the online timetable for Ventura’s 733 (Box
Hill – Oakleigh). This meant that passengers checking the timetable
during the third week of January would have expected a 15 min peak
service when buses only arrived every half-hour.

CDCM also suspended the 601 (Huntingdale – Monash Uni) shuttle from 29
to 31 December, however PTV continued to show times online. 601 normally
would runs a 12 min service during this time, however with even summer
students enjoying a week off, the parallel 630 and 900 proved more than
sufficient.

In the days prior to Christmas, Kastoria staff advised that buses on 476
(Moonee Ponds – Hillside) would follow a holiday timetable from 28
December until 15 January, similar to 475 (Moonee Ponds – Keillor) & 476
(Moonee Ponds – Niddrie), however no altered timetable was available
online. Then, a week later, a holiday timetable did (incorrectly) appear
on the PTV website, with the timetables from 2013-2014, the last year a
holiday timetable was in use for 476, prior to changes to the route in
Hillside. This incorrectly showed a 30 min all day service, whereas
buses were running every 20 mins during peaks and 40 mins interpeak. A
call to Kastoria advised that this was incorrect, and a school holiday
timetable was in operation. The timetable vanished later in the week.

Moonee Valley Coaches ran a reduced timetable from 29 December to 15
January, but only times for 506 (Moonee Ponds – Westgarth) surfaced
online, with no timetable published for the 503 (Essendon – East
Brunswick).

Issues with PTV website database also surfaced for East-West 561 (Coburg
– Macleod) and CDC Geelong 1 (Deakin Uni – North Shore) and 22 (Geelong
– North Shore) with entire timetables in one direction missing for over
a week at a time. Despite immediate feedback to PTV, their online
timetable database is normally only updated weekly, and in some cases
further technical hiccups preventing the issue being resolved for
longer. Back-up information at the call centre provided non-existent,
with staff members unable to assist passengers other than suggest they
call the operators directly during business hours.

A “holiday shopping” timetable Route 10 (Lara – Corio Village) (see
below) also failed to appear on the PTV website for over a week and a
half after it commenced on 20 December (details below). Passengers could
however check times using a PDF on the CDC Victoria website. A further
issue emerged at the end of January when PTV failed to show the Corio
Village trips operating on 31 January, after operators in Geelong were
given permission to delay bus timetable changes by 1 day to fit in with
staff rosters.

**Kastoria enhancements**

24 January saw new Kastoria timetables for selected routes 460 & 462
(Caroline Springs – Watergardens) plus 476 (Moonee Ponds – Plumpton).

Peak services on 460 were boosted from 30 mins to 25 mins. Offpeak and
weekend services now operate every 40 mins instead of hourly, and
services now continue from 21:00 to 23:00 on Friday and Saturday nights,
complementing the 942 Night Bus along Gourlay Rd.

460 services now terminate on Caroline Springs Bvd rather than continue
into the Caroline Springs Square carpark (215, 418 & 462 still depart
here). It has been suggested the change will allow 460 to be extended
5km south to the new Caroline Springs Station mid-year when it finally
opens.

476 now continues 1 km west from Hillside to the Aspire Estate in
Plumpton. Other than expanded coverage, the change also prevents issues
with the former loop around The Regency, which had seen passengers often
miss their bus only for it to layup at the terminus. An irregular
deviation has been added via Keilor Cemetery, saving visitors the 800m
walk across a footbridge over Calder Freeway. Runtimes and span have
also been amended. CDCM continue to offer a free bus to the cemetery
once a month from St Albans as part of their support of the Brimbank
Widows group.

462 updates address late running and extend span past 21:00 weeknights
but still runs hourly which is insufficient for heavy loads at school
times.

**Wyndham revisions**

CDCM commenced new timetables on 31 January for Werribee Depot routes
150, 151, 160, 167, 180 & 192. Run times for 180 & 192 have been sped up
by as much as 5 mins, while early morning services were moved on account
of the now deferred changes to the Geelong line V/Line timetable (see
*Rail News*).

Although times for the politically-sensitive 190 shuttle from Wyndham
Vale to Werribee were not adjusted, Geelong – Werribee travel times
remain the same, but connection times merely become up to 12 mins as
trains are travelling from Geelong faster.

**Keysborough South consultation**

Residents of Keysborough South in Melbourne’s south-east are set to
finally gain a bus service by mid 2016 after PTV undertook community
consultation last month on a proposed bus service to the suburb which
has gradually grown over the past decade, with over 7000 residents
calling it home at the last census in 2011.

Option A would see a new route between Noble Park and Keysborough South
before returning to Parkmore Shopping Centre, while Option B would see
the existing 709 from Mordialloc extended to Noble Park but potentially
no longer operating via residential streets in Waterways – a feature
lake would see some residents having to walk over a kilometre to the
buses on Springvale or Governor Roads. No changes are proposed to
existing routes within Keysborough.

Daytime services are proposed to operate every 40 mins, with evening
services until 9pm departing hourly.

**Geelong consultation, holiday shopping & February changes**

A flaw of the new Geelong network introduced in June was the deletion
of a significant portion of services operating between Corio Village and
the satellite suburb of Lara, with services cut from seven days week to
just a handful of peak services. Corio Village is an important hub for
Lara, being the closest medium sized centre. A local campaign was
started shortly after the changes, and by the end of July PTV undertook
a brief round of consultation to confirm that residents wanted the link
restored.

In December it was announced by the local member John Eren that Route 10
would again run to Corio Village seven days a week, initially with a
“holiday shopping” timetable from 20 December to 30 January (later
extended to include 31 January) before a more permanent solution was
implemented. The “holiday shopping” timetable saw hourly services
reinstated from 9am to 4pm each day, slotted in-between hourly Lara
South shortworkings.

In order to rationalise resources, from 1 February interpeak services on
10 between Lara South & Lara as well on 11 (Lara – Lara East) were
halved to hourly. Additional peak trips to/from Corio Village have also
been added to the 10 timetable.

Services on 12 (Lara – Lara West) moved to a 40-20-40-20 pattern to
better meet connecting trains. The Lara West loop now travels via Grand
Lakes Way, Westlakes Bvd, Eastlakes Bvd, Canterbury Road West, Yoorok
Dr, Eastlakes Bvd & Grand Lakes Way; instead of via Nankeen Av, Cape
Barron Dr, Westlakes Bvd and Grand Lakes Way, expanding coverage in new
pockets of the estate plus taking buses away from streets where
residents had complained about buses being added in June.

At Waurn Ponds Station, Routes 40 & 41 now travel more directly via
Bodega St rather than Monterey Dr.

McHarrys have also adjusted all their timetables for improved
reliability and Geelong line train connections, although the train
timetable update was delayed.

In late 2015 PTV also undertook consultation for minor route changes in
Geelong to Route 41 to serve Francis St Belmont and Route 30 to serve
Watsons Road in Newcomb, following community requests. These changes
have not been fulfilled with the February updates.

**Other regional updates**

CDCB updated their 3 Creswick service on 31 January with minor changes.

Due to the delay in changes to the V/Line timetable, PTV have advised
adjustments to the following routes have been deferred until further
notice:

-   433, 434 & 435 Bacchus Marsh Town Services (Bacchus Marsh Coaches)
-   473 Gisborne – Gisborne Station (Sunshine Tours)
-   Swan Hill – Tooleybuc (Swan Hill Bus Lines)
-   Cowes – Wonthaggi (Phillip Island Bus Lines)

**Extra school services in the north-east**

To alleviate overcrowding on Dysons’ 517 services passing Viewbank
College, an additional school bus was added to Greensborough Station via
Yallambie during term 3, with three buses now travelling this route
after school. The school bus to/from Heidelberg Station also now picks
up at Rosanna station to utilise spare capacity to reduce the strain on
the 517 to/from Northland. These improvements meet an ALP Bus Plan
commitment.

New school buses from Doreen to both Diamond Valley College and St
Helena College were introduced at the start of the 2016 school year as a
precursor to upcoming network changes currently under consultation.

**Pride March detours**

Due to the Gay and Lesbian Pride March in St Kilda on 31 January,
services on 600, 606, 922 and 923 were diverted away from Fitzroy St
from 1230 to 1630. The 606 was truncated at Park St with no services on
to Elwood or Elsternwick during this time.

**Manningham Mover sub-contracting**

Mitsubishi Rosas from Crown Coaches have been hired by Transdev on an
ad-hoc basis since at least 20 December after continual fleet shortages
on the Manningham Mover 280 & 282 services. Rumours uggest one hot
afternoon a few days earlier had seen changeover cars and even a ute
operating the service prior to the arrangement taking effect!

Crown Coaches provide their own driver who is directed along the complex
route by a Transdev employee. Although there are reports that portable
myki readers are used, some instances passengers simply enjoy a free
ride. A Toyota Coaster owned by Transdev had already made regular
appearances on the route.

Ironically, the original idea for the Manningham Mover was born out of
the Council’s idea to run mini-bus community buses around the area for a
\$1 fare after Ventura foreshadowed route changes in 2008 to the replace
the 283 Bulleen Loop with a new service on to Heidelberg.

As previously reported, Crown Coaches operated 8 morning school runs on
behalf of Transdev during 2015 after buses were required for extra
‘unadvertised’ Eastern Freeway commuter services following the reduction
in Zone 1+2 fares to Zone 1 prices.

**Overnight connection buffer**

A staff guide issued for the new Night Network states that all Night Bus
services connecting at suburban stations must wait to up to 30 mins for
late running Night Train connections or rail replacement buses during
trackworks or unplanned disruptions. This includes routes departing from
the City passing stations such as Caulfield, Ringwood and South Morang.

On New Years Eve, despite more frequent services operating, drivers
continued to observe this arrangement, even waiting for trains at
Dandenong when returning inbound towards Elsternwick. Two trips for
Cranbourne departed Dandenong around 0230 with up to 40 passengers each,
due to long gap between Cranbourne shuttle trains of over an hour.

**15 years without change**

Two suburban Melbourne bus timetables on the PTV website has now reached
15 years of operation:

-   531 (Upfield – North Coburg) dated 22 January 2001
    (Broadmeadows Bus)
-   546 (Heidelberg – Melbourne Uni) dated 5 February 2001 (Dysons)

The effective date for 531 actually relates to when the 2000/1 holiday
timetables concluded for Broadmeadows Bus for Route 530 & 532, and the
timetable for this hourly weekday service has amazingly remained
unchanged since the mid 1980s (a scan of the 1989 timetable can be found
on the *ATA Facebook page*). Is there a metropolitan example anywhere
else in Australia where a timetable has not changed for 15 or 30 years?
