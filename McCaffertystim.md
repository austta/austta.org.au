title: McCafferty's & Greyhound - Historical Timetables
---

Compiled by Steven Haby

Last updated: 26 August 2003

This document lists all historical timetables issued by McCafferty's for all
services including national express, Queensland regional services and
services operated since the acquisition of Greyhound Pioneer.
McCafferty's issued timetables for specific services, e.g. their
Toowoomba - Brisbane "Metro-Link" coordinated service with Queensland
Rail in addition to their booklets.

For a period in the 1980s McCafferty's services were given names, e.g.
Daylight Pacific which was the daylight service between Sydney and
Brisbane via the Pacific Highway.

Like any list of this nature, it is considered to be a work in progress
and additions can be send by email to <sghaby@hotmail.com>.
