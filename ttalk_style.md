# Deadline
The deadline for each issue is usually the last weekend of each month.\
(*Exception: The January edition is subject to advice from the printer as to their Christmas shutdown arrangements.*)

# Style
The aim is to maintain good standards of English, and to have a magazine which looks good, but looks different to the ATA’s other magazine, the Times.

# Font and Layout
10 point, Arial. (Main Headings: 12 point Arial **Bold**, Sub Headings: 10 point, Arial, **Bold**)

Two columns.

## Dates and Times
Dates: day/month/year, eg 6 August 2015, 12 Sept 2018.

Time: In 24 hour clock, eg, 0615, 0850, 1245, 1515, 2010.
(This is the result of debate in the Association a few years ago.)\
(*Exception: When quoting directly from a document, the original style should be maintained.*)

## Spelling
British, not American spelling.\
(*Exception: program, not programme.*)

## Other
The following guidelines are not necessarily right or wrong. Rather, the idea is to maintain standardisation within the magazine.

Spell out numbers from one to ten. Use numerals for numbers 11 and above.

Abbreviate Street to St.\
(*Exception: Spell out Street in full when it is in close proximity to the abbreviation St for Saint, for example Arthur Street, St Albans; Fitzroy Street, St Kilda*).

Generally, avoid other abbreviations. Spell out Road, Parade, Highway, etc in full.
Use “and” not “&”; use “would” not “wd”; use “could” not “cd”, etc.
However, well-known abbreviations which will be well-known to readers should be used, eg “km” not “kilometre”, “ARTC” not “Australian Rail Track Corporation”, TfNSW” not “Transport for New South Wales”, etc. However use the long form occasionally to maintain readers’ familiarity.

Follow the current trend to not capitalise some words, eg “station” not “Station”, “government” not “Government”.

On first mention in any news item, indicate which government, eg “The Federal government has decided…”, “The NSW government will implement…”, “The Victorian Minister for Transport…”

De-politicise press releases, eg, change “Morrison government” to “Federal government”, change “Andrews government” to Victorian government”, and so on.
Political neutrality will be maintained.

On first mention in any news item, spell out any abbreviations not commonly understood by everyone, eg, “Buses terminate at the Queen Victoria Building”, but subsequently just “QVB”.
(The test is: Will this Sydney abbreviation be understood by every Melbourne reader; will this Brisbane abbreviation be understood by Perth readers, etc.)
Be conscious of when the magazine is going to appear. So, almost always, when you receive some news about something that is going to happen, it must be written in the past tense, as if it has already happened, because that is when the readers will be reading it.
