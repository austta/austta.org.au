## **Queensland Rail CityTrain: Kippa Ring line delayed**

Opening of the Petrie-Kippa Ring line has been delayed due to signalling
faults. Opening had been expected on 11 July. The Queensland Minister
for Transport, Stirling Hinchcliffe, says that advice from QR was that
the signalling system was not safe. Three trains could not pass through
Petrie station without the system crashing. The system should be able to
handle 26 signalling changes at once when trains pass through Petrie but
was failing after 15. The Minister blames spending cuts that the former
government made to the project. It is believed that there are a number
of problems with signalling, track irregularities, power supply capacity
and many faults in the trains. QR will determine when the link will now
open.

An independent audit of the handling of the Moreton Bay Rail Link’s
signalling system will report to Mr Hinchcliffe by the end of July. The
review will consider governance and contractual processes relating to
the signalling system and the performance and integration of the systems
during design and construction. This review will run separately to the
work being undertaken by QR into the requirements of the signalling
systems in order for Moreton Bay Rail Link to open. The audit will look
at:

-   Any signalling system related issues, risks and/or opportunities
    arising from the decision in 2012 to bring the project under the
    auspices of the Department of Transport and Main Roads;
-   A review of the signalling system elements of the tendering and
    contract process;
-   Whether the role assigned to QR through contractual and/or
    governance documents and processes provided for appropriate
    involvement of the rail operator in the assurance processes relating
    to signalling;
-   Contract milestone payments relating to signalling, and gainshare
    payments, and the grounds upon which any payments have been made;
-   Performance and integration of signalling systems during design and
    construction, including:

    -   The nature of assurance activities by the project team, QR, or
        other parties to monitor, test, and review signalling systems
        and signalling system interface/integration
    -   The nature of interface/integration issues experienced between
        multiple signalling systems on the one network;
    -   The adequacy of assurance activities, and lessons for future
        rail contract selection and oversight;
    -   The processes by which concerns raised by QR or other parties
        regarding the signalling systems or signalling system
        integration were managed; and
    -   The assurance program being implemented by QR in order to have
        the project commissioned.

## **Queensland Budget**

The Queensland Budget, presented on 14 June, included the following new
public transport funding:

-   \$634 million over the next eight years to fund European Train
    Control System (ETCS) signalling. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said
    this would lay the foundation for the delivery of cross-river rail
    and would improve rail capacity and safety on the inner city
    rail network. It will be installed between Milton and Northgate. It
    will boost inner-city rail capacity by 20% and allow an extra eight
    trains an hour with 12,000 people through the CBD each peak period.
-   \$50 million to establish a Cross River Rail Delivery Authority to
    oversee the final planning and delivery of this project. It will
    commence early works on the project, including gaining environmental
    impact approvals, scoping of value share opportunities and
    commencing appropriate procurement activities; and
-   \$95 million for North Coast Line capacity improvement.

## **Queensland rail freight**

Oakey Beef Exports in Dalby, southern Queensland, will switch its
processed meat exports from road to rail.

## **Storms 5-6 June: NSW and Tasmania**

Among the effects of the storms that lashed the east coast of Australia
in early June, especially on 5-6 June, were temporary closure of
**Sydney Trains’** Eastern Suburbs and Cabramatta-Granville lines.

On 6 June **NSW TrainLink’s** 1150 up Canberra-Sydney Xplorer DMU hit a boulder near Bungendore. It was terminated at Tarago and taken out of service for repair. Consequently the 0650 Canberra to Sydney and 1208 Sydney to Canberra services were replaced by buses on the weekend of 11 and 12 June.

The entire **TasRail** freight network was closed on 6 June as a
precautionary measure. The short and relatively busy section from
Railton to Devonport reopened from 1800 on 7 June for cement trains.
Elsewhere, there was heavy damage. The most serious was in the
Deloraine-Kimberley area on the Western Line, severing the link between
the ports of Burnie and Devonport and the remainder of the network.
Other lines were also impacted:

-   A section of rail bridge over the Mersey River at Kimberley
    partially collapsed,
-   The ballast supporting other sections of track between Deloraine and
    Railton was washed away,
-   There was ballast damage between Clarendon and Evandale. Thousands
    of tonnes of logs washed against the Emu River Bridge at Burnie,
    although it is unlikely the bridge suffered serious structural
    damage,
-   A landslip near Rosebery closed the Melba Line servicing Tasmania’s
    west coast,
-   Damage to the Hobart to Conara line,
-   There were washaways on the Fingal line used to freight coal from
    Fingal to Cement Australia at Railton. However, because the Railton
    plant has a stockpile of coal on site, repairs to the Fingal track
    were delayed to facilitate more urgent repair works,
-   There was serious flooding at TasRail’s East Tamar workshops,
    affecting work for a day or two.

The South Line from Brighton to Conara re-opened on the night of 13/14
June, enabling intermodal freight services to operate. This was critical
for customers such as Norske Skog, Nyrstar and Toll. Container handling
operations were installed at Conara, effectively enabling freight flows
to be restored along the major corridor between Brighton and Burnie.

As at mid June TasRail expected that the landslip repair on the Melba
line, a particularly challenging worksite due to its steepness and
narrow width and the remoteness of the location, would be completed by
late June. TasRail was hopeful that repairs to a number of other sites
in the north would be completed within a few days, enabling the East
Tamar to Western Junction and the Western Junction to Conara Lines to
re-open by midnight on Sunday 19 June. The Bell Bay and Fingal Lines
were operational. Repair of the Kimberley Rail Bridge were progressing
with urgency. TasRail expected this would re-open by mid to late July.
The task to clear the remaining debris washed up at the Emu River Rail
Bridge continued. TasRail expected this to open within a few days.

Additional train capacity has been added to the Devonport to Railton
cement service at the request of this major customer.

## **New South Welsh Budget**

The NSW Budget, presented on 21 June, included the following new public
transport funding:

-   \$6.2 billion towards Sydney Metro City and Southwest and \$5.8
    billion for Sydney Metro Northwest over the next 4 years,
-   More than \$1 billion for new suburban trains for Sydney's network
    over the next four years This is the first major purchase for Sydney
    Trains since the troubled Waratah project almost a decade ago.
    Patronage on Sydney Trains' network is growing at about 8% a year.
    The new suburban trains are expected to begin to arrive at the time
    of a major timetable change for the rail network. That will occur
    before the first stage of the \$20 billion-plus metro rail network
    opens in mid-2019. However a decision on the number of trains to be
    purchased and when they will be delivered will depend on the outcome
    of a procurement process beginning this year. The new suburban
    trains are unlikely to be newly designed, unlike the order made
    several years ago for a new intercity fleet,
-   \$407 million to improve rail services, including higher frequency
    of trains on the Western Line and the new South West Rail Link,
-   \$64 million on planning and preparatory work for the Parramatta
    light rail project,
-   \$280 million for extra car parking at train stations, improved
    accessibility and upgrades to ferry wharves,
-   \$208 million to upgrade and maintain grain lines in country NSW,
-   \$142 million towards construction of Newcastle light rail,
-   \$32.5 million to continue planning major rail projects across NSW
    including the Sydney Metropolitan Freight Network, Main West, Main
    South, Lower Hunter Freight Corridor including the Newcastle Freight
    bypass from Fassifern to Hexham, Northern Sydney Freight Corridor
    and Southern Sydney Freight Line,
-   \$10.5 million (part of a \$15 million pilot) for Fixing Country
    Rail, kick starting the full \$400 million program to upgrade
    country rail including helping to open unused rail lines,
-   \$5 million to continue rolling out the Freight Noise Action Plan to
    reduce rail freight noise and help improve amenity for residents
    living near major rail corridors, and
-   \$5 million to continue improving operations at Port Botany to
    reduce truck turn-around times and increase the number of containers
    on each train.

## NSW rural inquiry


The NSW Parliament will inquire into transport access for seniors and
disadvantaged people in rural NSW. The Committee on Community Services
is looking at the availability of current transport services and what
initiatives are needed to improve access. The inquiry is calling for
submissions by 21 July on how the Government can improve access to
transport services for seniors, people with a disability, and
disadvantaged people in rural areas. It will also look at current
timetabling and any potential support that can be provided to assist
with the costs of private transport where public transport is
unavailable. This follows recent moves to decrease staffing at NSW
TrainLink stations (mainly in fact not carried out), and withdrawal of
lower cost accommodation on Great Southern Rail’s Indian Pacific train.

## Victoria: Regional Network Development Plan


The Victorian Government launched a Regional Network Development Plan on
30 May - the first-ever long term plan to improve public transport in
regional Victoria. It will guide short, medium and long term priorities
to modernise the network with more track, more train, better facilities
and more services. It sets out a medium to long term plan to deliver a
modern commuter-style service for the growth areas of Geelong, Bendigo,
Ballarat, Seymour and Traralgon, and service improvements to outer
regional areas. It outlines a pathway to deliver:

-   a commuter-style service with a minimum 20 minute train frequency in
    the peak,
-   a 40 minute off-peak frequency of services to Melbourne,
-   five services, five days a week to the outer regional train lines of
    Warrnambool, Bairnsdale, Albury-Wodonga, Echuca, Swan Hill
    and Shepparton.

The Victorian government has invested \$1.3 billion in the 2016/17 state
budget to start many projects in the plan including:

-   More than 170 extra off-peak services, building on the 342 services
    added in 2015,
-   Purchase of an additional 27 VLocity carriages and stabling
    infrastructure,
-   Critical major maintenance to guard against deterioration of the
    network and improve train reliability,
-   Funding to rebuild V/Line capacity and deliver the services
    passengers expect and deserve,
-   Car parking, passenger facilities and customer information upgrades
    at over 30 regional stations/coach interchanges,
-   Development funding for the next phase of works in the Plan.

Several initiatives proposed by regional Victorians will be trialled,
including running coach services directly to outer Melbourne, allowing
bikes on buses in tourist areas, and introducing services to cater for
seasonal travel demand in places like the Bellarine Peninsula.

## **V/Line: Ballarat line woes**

Due to a “severe speed restriction” at Melton Weir bridge, a number of
cutbacks were made to Ballarat line services from Wednesday 1 June:

-   0518 Melbourne Southern Cross-Bacchus Marsh empty cars terminates at
    Melton
-   0613 SX-Ballarat is cancelled and replaced by a bus
-   0726 SX-Ballarat is cancelled and replaced by a bus
-   0817 SX-Ararat terminates at Wendouree with replacement bus
    Ballarat-Ararat
-   1237 SX-Bacchus Marsh terminates at Melton with replacement bus
    Melton-Bacchus Marsh
-   1337 SX-Bacchus Marsh terminates at Melton with replacement bus
    Melton-Bacchus Marsh
-   1437 SX-Bacchus Marsh is cancelled and replaced by a bus
-   0709 Bacchus Marsh-Melton empty cars is cancelled
-   1330 Bacchus Marsh-SX originates at Melton with replacement bus
    Bacchus Marsh-SX
-   1228 Ararat-SX originates at Wendouree with replacement bus
    Ararat-SX
-   1430 Bacchus Marsh-SX originates at Melton with replacement bus
    Bacchus Marsh-SX
-   1530 Bacchus Marsh-SX is cancelled and replaced by a bus
-   1605 Bacchus Marsh-SX empty cars is cancelled
-   1552 Ballarat-SX is cancelled and replaced by a bus.

There are a few consequential adjustments to some train compositions.

The Rowsley crossing loop, on the down side of Bacchus Marsh, was
commissioned in early June. However there are currently no crosses
scheduled there. It is expected to come into regular use with an
upgraded timetable from next year.

## **V/Line: Albury line slowdown**

Commencing 26 June all V/Line trains on the Albury have been slowed down
by five minutes by the insertion of recovery time at the last stage of
their journeys. For down trains, there is an additional five minutes
between Wodonga and Albury, now arriving Albury at 1100, 1555 and 2205.
For up trains, the additional five minutes is between Franklin St and
Southern Cross, arriving SX at 1035, 1640 and 2145.

## **V/Line: Echuca line bustitution 18-20 June**

Most closedowns of lines for engineering works are programmed for
weekends because that is when there are fewer trains and fewer
passengers. A recent V/Line closedown had the opposite effect. A closure
from North Bendigo Junction to Echuca was from Saturday 18 to Monday 20
June. However, on the Echuca line there is only one train on weekdays,
but on weekends there are two each way, mainly because of tourist
traffic.

## **Qube & V/Line: Altered freight trains**

From 4 July Qube’s container trains:

-   0505 Tues, Thurs and 0520 Sats Westgate Port Siding
    (Melbourne)-Tocumwal are cancelled and replaced by
-   0001 Tues, Thurs, Sats Westgate Port Siding-Tocumwal arriving 0540
-   1505 Tues, Thurs Tocumwal-Westgate Port Siding is cancelled and
    replaced by
-   1545 Tues, Thurs Tocumwal-Westgate Port Siding arriving 2140
-   2200 Sats Tocumwal-Westgate Port Siding is cancelled and replaced by
-   1610 Sats Tocumwal-Westgate Port Siding arriving 2120
-   0505 Mons, Weds, Fris Westgate Port Siding-Deniliquin via Toolamba
    is cancelled and replaced by
-   0120 Mons, Weds, Fris Westgate Port Siding via Bendigo 0400-0405
    arriving Deniliquin 0740
-   1700 Mons, Weds, Fris Deniliquin-Westgate Port Siding via Bendigo is
    cancelled and replaced by
-   1255 Mons, Weds, Fris Deniliquin-Westgate Port Siding via Toolamba
    1645-1655 arriving 2010.

## **Metro Trains: Southern Cross chaos**

An incident closed portion of Southern Cross station on Friday
afternoon, 24 June, causing problems for Metro Trains Melbourne and, of
course, travellers. Police were called to the station about 1430 after a
trespasser positioned himself on a metal platform attached to a bridge.
They successfully coaxed him down just before 1630. Some Metro Trains
ran direct to Flinders St. Minor delays persisted into the afternoon
peak. V/Line was apparently unaffected.

## **Melbourne: Late night boozers like public transport**

Late-night travellers are increasingly using public transport to get
home rather than catching taxis or walking. Patronage on the Night
Network has been steadily growing since a trial started in January and
trains have now overtaken walking as the most common method of getting
home late at night, with cabs and driving also waning. Patronage has
grown enough to justify continuing the policy, which involves an extra
300 train services, 250 tram services and 485 bus services each weekend.
Train use jumped 11% soon after the system was launched, with tram use
up by 9%. Taxi use dropped 8% and walking dropped 7%.

## **TransWA: Prospector**

From 13 June 2016 the Prospector (Perth-Kalgoorlie and v.v.) picks up
and sets down passengers at Toodyay.

## **Perth: Long wait for a tram**

Plans to build the MAX light rail line to Perth's northern suburbs have
been abandoned, Dean Nalder, the WA Transport Minister, confirmed on 21
June. He blamed lack of federal funding. The plan was a central element
of the Government’s 2013 election promises.

## **Auckland developments**

On 2 June ceremonial first work took place for the Auckland City Rail
Link, the \$NZ 2.5bn project to construct 3.4km of twin-bore tunnels up
to 42m beneath the city from the current terminus at Britomart to Mount
Eden. It is estimated that the Link will double peak-time usage on
Auckland's rail network to 30,000 passengers. It is expected to take 5.5
years to build and will involve tunnel boring and cut-and-cover
construction, two new stations at Aotea and Karangahape Road and the
redevelopment of Mount Eden station. Auckland is expected to grow by up
to 700,000 people in the next 30 years.

In April patronage on both the rail network and the North Shore busway
increased 30% compared to a year earlier. The network now has over 20
million trips annually or just under 25% of all public transport trips,
an increase of five million trips in 18 months. A decade ago it was
fewer than 5 million trips and accounted for less than 10% of all trips.

## **Amtrak: Goodbye system timetable**

Amtrak, the US long-distance passenger train operator, no longer prints
its hard copy system-wide timetable book. The last one was dated 11
January 2016. Downloadable versions will still be available. Printed
route-specific timetables will still be available. See
<https://www.amtrak.com/train-schedules-timetables>

## Why short-haul intermodal rail services succeed (Research Report 139)

The shipping container has revolutionised freight transport over the
last half-century but its success is bringing challenges, not least in
landside container movements. Port-induced road traffic congestion
impacts on port arteries and communities, and undermines port
efficiency. Policymakers and planners seek to shift activities from
roads to rail. This is a challenge, however, because most of the
containers move over short distances, where trains are relatively
uncompetitive. Despite that, there are instances where port–hinterland
rail services exist. This report analyses the underlying necessary
conditions that need to prevail for those rail services to be
sustainable.

## Lengthy commutes in Australia (Research report 144)


The research provides a solid evidence-base to understand who is
undertaking lengthy commutes (those longer than 45 minutes one way),
their prevalence and trends. It also explores whether some individuals
undertake lengthy commutes for long periods or whether it tends to be
temporary.

# **BUS NEWS**

## **Australian Capital Territory**

Without any publicity, a new edition of ACTION’s Weekday Bus book is
available. It bears a front cover date which is merely “2016”. It
appears to be merely a reprint of the preceding edition dated 18 May
2015, with a few minor fiddles included. Copies are available from the
Australian Timetable Association’s July Distribution List.

The ACT Budget presented on 7 June included funding of:

-   A new, free Canberra City Loop bus from 4 July;
-   \$10 million over two years for 20 new buses as part of the ongoing
    fleet replacement program;
-   \$3.5 million over four years for improvements to public transport
    services in Weston Creek and the Molonglo region. This includes a
    new all-day direct service called the Weston Line providing improved
    connectivity between Woden, Cooleman Court in Weston and the City.
    To meet increasing demand, Wright will receive increased coverage
    and frequency and the Route 83 and Xpresso 783 services will be
    extended to include Coombs;
-   \$1.5 million for the design and construction of a new Park and Ride
    facility in Wanniassa;
-   \$300,000 for improvements to the Woden bus interchange;
-   \$900,000 for a 12-month trial of up to three electric buses on
    regular on- and off-peak route services;
-   \$775,000 for the design of a new bus depot in Woden to cater for
    growth in the bus fleet and meet the future needs of bus transport
    in the ACT. An amount has been provisioned for the construction
    component; and
-   \$3 million for an integrated ticketing system for buses and
    light rail.

## **Western Australia**

### **17 July: New Perth Busport**

The new Perth Busport opened on Sunday 17 July. Services no longer run
from Roe St Bus Station. The following services were altered:

-   Routes 81, 82, 83, 84 and 85 reverted to their former route into the
    CBD, operating via Sutherland St and Wellington St in lieu of
    Roe St. Route 84 runs an additional trip on a Sunday evening.
-   Route 85 now runs several additional trips throughout the week,
    including later weeknight trips, and a new Sunday service providing
    improved public transport access within West Leederville.
-   Route 386 now runs as an all stops service. Route 386 limited stops
    services are renumbered to Route 385 to avoid confusion. Route 385
    will run the same route at the same times as the limited stops
    Route 386.

The following changes are unrelated to the opening of Perth Busport:

-   Route 881 renumbered to Route 114.
-   Route 940 renumbered to Route 115 and operates with fewer services
    on Sunday evening.
-   Routes 150, 160, 170, 176, 179, 245, 250, 422, 504, 514 and 531 all
    have time changes.

The following routes have additional trips:

-   Route 177 additional services on Sunday evening.
-   Route 254 runs as a new two hourly service on Sundays, replacing
    Byford services previously provided on Route 251.
-   Route 254 has an additional weekday evening service from Armadale
    to Byford.
-   Route 341 has one additional afternoon trip from Morley Bus Station
    to Beechboro.
-   Route 415 has one additional morning peak trip from Stirling Station
    to Mirrabooka Bus Station and return.
-   Route 421 has one additional morning peak trip from Scarborough
    Beach to Stirling Station.
-   Route 525 has an additional eight trips during weekday peak,
    improving the frequency to every 10 minutes.
-   Route 526 has an additional trip during afternoon school peak.
-   Route 532 has two additional short trips, one replacing a withdrawn
    Route 522 trip.
-   Route 930 has a number of the afternoon peak services currently
    running between Elizabeth Quay bus station and Westfield Carousel
    Shopping Centre extended to Thornlie station.
-   Additional Route 930 services run on Sunday evenings.

The following routes have a reduced number of trips / shortened trips:

-   Route 251 reduced throughout the week due to poor patronage.
-   Route 252 no longer extends Saturday services to Serpentine due to
    poor patronage. Between Mundijong and Armadale there is no change to
    the number of trips running. Serpentine passengers can catch TransWA
    Australind services which operate to Armadale / Perth twice daily.
-   Route 423 no longer runs the 0755 trip from Karrinyup Bus Station to
    Stirling Station due to poor patronage. Passengers can instead catch
    the 0749 or 0759. The 0805 trip departing Stirling Station to
    Warwick Station on weekdays will depart at the earlier time of 0754.
    This change is to ensure an on-time arrival at Sacred Heart College.
-   Route 520 has fewer trips on a Sunday evening, however an additional
    trip runs for weekday peak servicing Lakelands Senior High School.
-   Route 522 has one less trip to Cockburn Central. This is replaced
    with an additional short-working on Route 532.

The Public Transport Authority of WA has called tenders, closing 30
June, for **Karratha** regional bus services.

## **TRANSPERTH: Timetable Guide effective 31/01/2016\* Review by David
Whiteford**

I last reviewed a Transperth timetable guide in *Table Talk* 267 (Nov.
2014) and it was the issue “effective from the opening of Butler
Station”. The Joondalup railway extension to Butler was opened on 21
September 2014. Since then the guide was reissued effective 1/2/2015;
9/8/2015; 11/10/2015; 22/11/2015; 31/1/2016 and 31/1/2016\* (the \* on a
Transperth timetable usually indicates a reprint rather than a reissue,
but this is not a reprint). I’ve often pondered the value of this guide
with its frequent reissues and the no doubt considerable expense in its
production (another will be due when the new Perth underground bus
station opens – probably before this appears in print).

The guide continues to be of Transperth timetable sized stapled booklet,
but now has enhanced content. It opens with a very diagrammatic rail
system map with ten bus stations and two ferry terminals noted. This map
had shown five coloured service areas, with timetables formerly
identified by their service area, e.g. E100 for bus route 37 in the
Eastern service area. The new guide of 11/10/2015 was issued for the
abolition of this service area identification of timetables and also was
the first to show the Ellenbrook bus transfer station on the map. The
closed Belmont Park special events railway station on the Armadale line
was still shown in the Butler issue, but was absent from the next issue
(1/2/2015).

Next is the index of route numbers and the timetable numbers for each
one. CAT buses, ferries and trains follow 3 ½ pages of bus routes.

In each review I’ve been disparaging about the suburb index and it
continues to disappoint. In the Butler issue, Butler was not even shown
as served by Joondalup line trains – and this was issued for the opening
of the railway to Butler! Amazingly, it *still* does not have the label
Joondalup line against it! I have also moaned about the exclusion of
non-suburb name railway stations (e.g. Challis), while including
institutions (e.g hospitals). The institutions last appeared in this
section in the issue of 9/2015. My moan about suburbs without a named
railway station (e.g. Heathridge and Jolimont) being given a railway
timetable note still stands. Rail timetables do not give any reference
to these suburbs.

I don’t think Transperth / PTA have read my reviews. ‘New’ suburbs – and
some old ones – are still not listed in the suburb list (e.g Serpentine
and Champion Lakes). However the three Mandurah area localities noted as
missing in my 2014 review (Wannanup, Barragup and Dudley Park) finally
make an appearance in the 31/1/2016\* issue (not the original 31/1
issue). Sinagra, mentioned in my last review, appears from 9/8/2015. And
Ascot finally is shown as served by TT110 as well as the circle route
200 from 22/11/2015 – yet should also be shown as served by TT109.
Kewdale, however, is another ‘circle route’ suburb not noted as being
served by TT200. Anyone wanting to travel to Cardup (south of Armadale
and Byford) will still have difficulty getting there using TT3. It was
wrong in 2014 and is still wrong. TT3 will get you to Armadale but then
you’ll need TT21 for services to Cardup.

Earlier I mentioned that institutions no longer appear in the locality
index. From the 11/10/2015 issue there are separate educational
institution and hospital guides after the suburb, train and bus station
lists. And from the 22/11/2015 issue ‘popular destinations’ and
‘shopping centre’ timetable guides appeared. These were never featured
in any previous place list and can be considered a useful improvement.

New features from the issue of 11/10/2015 are alphabetical lists of
train and bus stations following the suburb list. But only 37 of the 68
railway stations are listed. To be fair, its aim appears to be to show
the timetables for buses servicing the stations, but when you’ve
stations such as McIvor and Canning Bridge listed with no guide
elsewhere as to what railway line they are on (other than trying to find
them on the diagrammatic map) it seriously lessens the value of the
list.

Ah well. As a timetable collector, the guide is a necessary addition to
my collection. As a useful public service it’s of doubtful value and it
definitely needs to be corrected and better timetable links provided. Oh
– one final error to note. The limited outer-metropolitan bus extension
from Bullsbrook to Muchea ceased some time ago, but Muchea is still in
the suburb list, served by TT91.

I look forward to seeing the next issue soon.

# **AIR NEWS**

## **Domestic**

**Jetgo** will shift its Melbourne-Dubbo service from Avalon to Essendon
airport from 3 July following the installation of necessary security
screening facilities at Essendon. It had planned to fly from Dubbo to
Melbourne Tullamarine starting in October 2015, but was unable to secure
terminal space at the airport. Essendon Airport has constructed a
temporary terminal to accommodate Jetgo’s services while the
heritage-listed terminal undergoes a \$20 million refurbishment.
Currently, Essendon Airport, which is a busy charter airport, has
regular public transport service from Free Spirit Airlines and Sharp
Airlines to Flinders Island and Merimbula. Alliance Airlines also has
charter flights from the airport. Those services do not require
passenger security screening.

Jetgo’s inaugural [Brisbane-Albury
service](http://australianaviation.com.au/2016/04/jetgo-to-start-new-albury-brisbane-service/)
took off on 20 June. This operates four times a week. Jetgo is now
planning a Canberra to Gold Coast service.

## **International**

**AirAsia** has cancelled its Sydney-Bali and Melbourne-Bali flights
