# **TOP TABLE TALK – BUDGETS**

## **Federal Budget: Big railway projects**

The Federal Budget presented on 9 May
contained large expenditure for railway and public transport projects.

-   \$8.4 billion in new equity funding to the Australian Rail Track
    Corporation for the Melbourne to Brisbane Inland Rail project.

-   \$500 million for Regional Rail in Victoria. The aim is to improve
    travel times, reliability and frequency of services to increase the
    patronage of regional public transport services. This will include:

    -   Improvements to the North East line. On 11 May the Prime Minister
    said that this will be for re-sleepering and drainage work,

    -   Improvements to the Gippsland line, in particular the Avon River
    bridge near Stratford,

    -   Improved services on the Geelong line including \$100 million for
    duplication from Geelong to Waurn Ponds and second platforms at
    Marshall, South Geelong and Waurn Ponds, and

    -   A study into improving the Shepparton line.

-   A \$10 billion National Rail Program to deliver rail projects that
    provide better connections for cities and regions and create new
    opportunities to grow our economy. Projects such as Adelink tram
    system, Brisbane Metro, Tullamarine Railway, Cross River Rail in
    Brisbane, and the Western Sydney Airport Railway, might be supported
    through this program, subject to proven business cases.

-   \$20 million in 2017–18 to support business case development for
    improving the use of rail transport to ease pressures within
    Australia’s largest cities, and provide important links to regional
    centres.

-   \$30 million to develop a business case for a rail link to
    Tullamarine Airport.

-   \$20.2m for Murray Basin Rail in Victoria.

Already announced was \$700 million towards
the Perth Metronet project, subject to another \$500 million from the WA
government, and positive business cases, for railway extensions to
Yanchep and beyond Thornlie, and \$86 million for other Metronet related
projects. This money is mainly re-allocated from the cancelled Perth
Freight Link road project.

## **Victorian Budget: Big railway projects**

The Victorian Budget presented on 2 May
contained a provisional allocation of \$1.45 billion for upgrades to
regional railways comprising:

-   \$435 million for the Gippsland line, with an upgrade to the Avon
    River bridge;
-   \$100 million to allow the Warrnambool line to run more services,
    with a crossing loop in the Camperdown area (the press release is a
    bit unclear, but implies duplication all the way from Weerite to
    Boorcan, either side of Camperdown, about 20 km!), and signalling
    upgrades between Waurn Ponds and Warrnambool, a second platform and
    pedestrian crossing at Waurn Ponds;
-   \$110 million for the first stage of a new Surf Coast Rail Project,
    including duplication between South Geelong and Waurn Ponds, land
    corridor reservation between Torquay and Armstrong Creek for a
    future railway, and development funding for future stages;
-   \$91 million for the Bendigo / Echuca line, with signalling upgrades
    from Bendigo to Epsom and Eaglehawk and track speed upgrades between
    Bendigo and Echuca;
-   \$39 million for stage 2 of the Ballarat line upgrade, with Ararat
    stabling and signalling upgrades and track works around Ballarat.
    There will be an additional daily train to/from Ararat;
-   signalling and station improvements on the North-east line, with
    design work and enabling infrastructure for standard gauge VLocity
    DMUs, and station improvements at Donnybrook and Wallan;
-   \$43.5 million for new train stabling facilities at Shepparton, and
    a new crossing loop near Murchison East which will — from 2020
    onwards — enable the provision of more services.

However, the Victorian government says that this country rail upgrading
package was contingent on the Federal government handing over all the
money Victoria is entitled to under what is called an “asset recycling
fund”. This was set up to give states money if they privatised assets,
such as the Port of Melbourne, and spent the proceeds on
productivity-boosting infrastructure. The Federal Budget (see above)
contained big funding for these projects.

Other new transport projects are:

-   \$846 million to remove eight more level crossings in Melbourne,
-   \$10 million to develop a CBD to Airport rail plan in partnership
    with the private sector,
-   \$201.9 million to upgrade the busiest stations, and to continue to
    provide 24-hour public transport on weekends
-   \$187.4 million for train stabling at Kananook,
-   \$84.9 million to plan for more high capacity trains and
    infrastructure projects,
-   \$311 million for thirty-nine new V/Line rail carriages (13 sets),
-   \$12.5 million to refurbish V/Line’s “classic” train fleet,
-   \$67 million for additional metropolitan public transport services
    including eight more trains on the Werribee line, more than 50
    additional tram services on the north-west corridors and a St Kilda
    Road peak period shuttle, and additional tram services on routes 57,
    58 and 59,
-   Route extensions, upgrades and new services to the bus network in
    Bentleigh, Frankston, Mordialloc, Narre Warren, Craigieburn, Sunbury
    and Broadmeadows,
-   additional bus services, including in growth suburbs,
-   additional Parkville bus services to minimise transport disruptions
    from the construction of the Metro Tunnel,
-   \$67 million to improve safety on public transport, expanding the
    protection warning system on trains, and making station platforms
    safer,
-   \$8.7 million to upgrade train station access and facilities,
-   \$5 million to plan a long-term second phase upgrade to the
    Hurstbridge line,
-   \$218.1 million for ten more E-Class trams and new tramway
    infrastructure.

Then, on 15 May additional funding was announced:

-   A \$4 million upgrade of Donnybrook station
-   Almost \$7 million for a future railway at Toolern station on the
    Seymour line,
-   A \$9 million upgrade of car parking at Merinda Park station on the
    Cranbourne line
-   \$2 million for new bus bays and shelters at Cranbourne station,
-   \$7 million towards the new Hawkstowe station on the Mernda rail
    extension.

## **Australian Capital Territory**

The ACT Budget presented on 6 June contains funding for:

-   A new rapid bus from Belconnen to Gungahlin every 15 minutes
    0700-1900 Mon-Fri (“Black rapid”),
-   A new rapid bus from Woden to the City, via Manuka and Barton every
    15 minutes 0700-1900 Mon-Fri (‘Green rapid”). [The two new rapids
    will cost about \$3.6 million in
    2017-18](http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/act-government-announces-seven-new-rapid-bus-routes-in-network-overhaul-20160826-gr24zs.html)
    with an extra five routes to be introduced over the next four years.
-   The existing Blue Rapid from Tuggeranong to Belconnen to be extended
    to/from Lanyon Marketplace.
-   New bus stops at Nullarbor Avenue and Well Station Drive to link in
    with future light rail stops.
-   New ticket machines and a new ticketing system for bus and light
    rail.

## **Tasmanian Budget**

The Tasmanian Budget presented on 25 May, included funding of \$29.9 for railway infrastructure, and
\$100 million for the TT-Line Ship Replacement
Fund.

## **Northern Territory**

The NT Budget presented on 2 May provided \$37.2 million for public and
school bus transport, and \$760,000 to improve the regional bus program
and trial new passenger services in regional and remote areas.

## **New Zealand**

The NZ Budget presented on 25 May provided:

-   \$NZ 450 million for KiwiRail over two years for infrastructure and
    systems including restoration of the South Island Main Trunk line;
-   \$NZ 436 for Auckland’s City Rail Link; and
-   \$NZ 98.4 million for Wellington’s metro rail network to replace
    1274 remaining timber poles and overhead wires on the Hutt Valley,
    Melling and Johnsonville lines.

# **RAIL AND TRAM NEWS**

## **Inland Freight Railway**

Detailed information about the Brisbane-Melbourne Inland Freight Railway
is contained in statements placed on the Queensland Coordinators
General’s website seeking public comment on draft environmental
statements. The section from Calvert to Helidon, including a new 1.1.km
tunnel under the Little Liverpool Range, is at
<http://statedevelopment.qld.gov.au/assessments-and-approvals/inland-rail-helidon-to-calvert.html>
The section from Helidon to Gowrie (west of Toowoomba), including a
major 6.3 km tunnel under the Great Dividing Range, is at
<http://statedevelopment.qld.gov.au/assessments-and-approvals/inland-rail-gowrie-to-helidon.html>

These statements confirm these sections of the railway will be
dual-gauged. They state that the railway will be suitable for
double-stacked containers. They state the line will be single-track –
unlike the present railway, which is double track on the sections from
Calvert to Grandchester and Yarongmulu to Helidon. The documents refer
to the new railway being within “the existing Gowrie to Grandchester
future public transport corridor”, which implies a future passenger
train service - the design makes accommodation
for a future double track for passenger service. See also major
advertisements placed in the *Weekend Australian* (page 45) and the
*Courier-Mail* (pages 76-77) on 6 May 2017.

The Queensland government is believed to be considering signing over the
existing Goondiwindi to Toowoomba rail corridor to the Commonwealth for
use by the Brisbane to Melbourne Inland Freight Railway, in exchange for
rail and road infrastructure funding. Such a move could save the Federal
government from a fight with farmers who do not want land resumptions.

Federal Budget papers state that the Kagaru to Gowrie section, the most
expensive and engineering-challenged section, will be built as a
Public-Private consortium. Following the Federal Budget, the main
freight operators Aurizon and Pacific National, the Australasian Railway
Association, the Australian Logistics Council and the National Farmers
Federation issued statements welcoming the announcement. PN described
the project as “transformative for Australia.

The Secretary of the Federal Infrastructure Department, Mike Mrdak,
advised a Senate Estimates Committee on 22 May that “the ARTC will now
complete all of the environmental and planning assessment work, and then
we will start to go out into the market for design-and-construct
contracts. For a certain section of the work there will be a
public-private partnership availability payment project, which will also
be sourced from the private sector.” The General Manager, Inland Rail,
in the Department, Richard Wood, said the precise timing will be subject
to the detailed design process and the completion of all of the
decisions on the alignment of inland rail and on the precise engineering
construction”. He continued, ”Major construction works will commence
through this financial year on the Parkes-to-Narromine section. The
greenfield section—that is, where it is completely new track; for
example, 300 kms between Narromine and Narrabri in NSW—is a couple of
years away from construction, because of the need for environmental
impact assessment and detailed planning.” Mr Mrdak said, ”the business
plan, which is publicly available, makes it clear that the rates of
return available on a stand”-alone project like Inland Rail would not
meet the private sector commercial rates of return required....[of]
well above 11 to 13%. The business case is premised on an ARTC rate of
return of around five to 5.5%”.

Mr Fullerton, CEO, ARTC, said they were confident that on a conservative
estimate they would gain 60-65% of Melbourne-Brisbane freight compared
to 25% on the present route. The new route would offer transit time of
24 hours, competitive with road. 60% of the cost will be of the
difficult section through the Great Dividing Range near Toowoomba.
\[This section will also carry Queensland intra-state coal traffic.\] In
regard to the railway from Acacia Ridge to the port of Brisbane, Mr Wood
said, ”At some stage there would need to be either enhancements to the
existing line to the port to enable longer trains or more trains or both
or potentially a new dedicated link.“ In response to questions about
possible high-speed rail, “Mr Fullerton said, “the corridor will be
future-proofed for passenger trains from Toowoomba to Brisbane. That
future-proof could be simply providing enough width in the corridor to
install passenger lines in the future.” The project is expected to be
completed in 2024-25.

Updated maps of most of the proposed route are available at

## **ARTC Working Timetable 7 May 2017**

As well as the **tabular version** of the ARTC WTT of 7 May which was
already available on their website at
<https://www.artc.com.au/customers/operations/mtp/> the **graphical
version** is now also available at
<https://www.artc.com.au/customers/access/access-interstate/committed-capacity/>

From 9 May the ARTC Working Timetable was amended on the east-west line
in SA:

-   2PS7 on Mondays runs as tabled to arrive Spencer Junction 0710,
    depart 0900, pass Crystal Brook 1030, Peterborough 1144, Mannahill
    1304, arrive Mingary 1352, depart 1417, thence as tabled.
-   3PS7 on Tuesdays runs as tabled to arrive Kingoonya 2045, depart
    2105, arrive Wirraminna 2203, depart 2240, pass Pimba 2336, arrive
    Wirrappa 0002, depart 0025, arrive Spencer Junction 0215, depart
    0405, thence as tabled.

## **Freight Inquiry**

A panel of transport industry experts has been appointed to help the
Federal government develop a blueprint for Infrastructure investment in
the 21st century. On 9 March, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport
Darren Chester released the terms of reference for the *Inquiry into
Freight and Supply Chain Productivity.* He said the Inquiry would
support the delivery of the National Freight and Supply Chain strategy
by outlining how existing infrastructure can be best utilised and guide
future investment. The senior industry panel experts are Maurice
James—Managing Director of Qube, Nicole Lockwood—Principal of Lockwood
Advisory, and Board of Infrastructure Australia and Marika Calfas—CEO of
NSW Ports.

The draft inquiry will be shared with industry and government for
comment in late 2017, with the final report due by early 2018. For more
information see
<https://infrastructure.gov.au/transport/freight/national-strategy.aspx>

## **Aurizon: Cyclone Debbie**

Aurizon re-opened its Goonyella system on 26 April, and announced a 5%
decline in Queensland volumes as a result of Cyclone Debbie. The
re-opening ended a four-week outage while Aurizon’s maintenance,
engineering and civil teams worked to repair the damaged infrastructure.
This included major landslips which damaged track on Black Mountain,
west of Mackay.

Meanwhile, Aurizon announced an 8% growth in NSW coal volumes in the
March quarter, to 11.5 million tonnes. Together with the lower
Queensland volumes, Aurizon achieved a total above rail coal volume of
48.4 million tonnes, down 2% year-on-year. Aurizon’s freight volumes
were down 3% to 9.0 million tonnes in the third quarter. The company’s
less-significant iron ore volumes were down 7% to 5.6 million tonnes.

## **Brisbane Cross-River Rail stalled**

There are doubts about the Brisbane Cross-River Rail project, only a few
weeks before the state Budget as the Commonwealth demands residents pay
higher taxes to build it. The Prime Minister and Premier discussed the
project on 18 May. Mr Turnbull apparently has the view that businesses
and homeowners won’t pay enough towards the \$5.2 billion project. It’s
understood the Commonwealth wants details of how much the state can
raise in new taxes from homes and businesses in the rail corridor that
benefit from the project under value capture. They also want patronage
numbers and more detail on how it will connect with current public
transport and the planned Brisbane Metro.

Ms Palaszczuk later released a statement insisting the “completed”,
2000-page document had been with Infrastructure Australia (IA) since
June last year. Mr Turnbull said discussions would continue as he again
referred to the business case as a “proposal” that was “inadequate in a
number of respects. This is Infrastructure Australia’s view, and they
want to know more about its integration with other transport systems and
networks in southeast Queensland, about land use opportunities and
generally the development aspects of it,” he said. “It needs more work.
I am not making a criticism of it, I am just stating a fact.”

A leaked copy of the business case last year revealed up to \$7 billion
would be raised from “value capture” proposals. They included \$1.2
billion for a car park levy and \$1 billion in increased land tax on
property owners near Cross River Rail’s proposed stations. There is also
a proposal to collect up to \$2.6 billion through a public transport
infrastructure levy on property owners and a \$1 billion surcharge on
ticket prices.

A report by Infrastructure Australia, released on 26 May, has suggested
that Queensland Rail should be privatised to pay for building the Cross
River Rail project. It claims up to \$6.3 billion could be saved over 24
years if the government outsourced the running of train services to
private enterprise. Brisbane City Council could save up to \$1.9 billion
over the same period of time if it outsourced bus operations. The report
stated the outsourcing, or “franchising”, was not an asset sale and
should be sold to the public as a way of paying for new infrastructure
and services. For Queensland Rail, savings ranged \$1.8 billion to \$6.3
billion over 24 years depending on the model, while Brisbane Transport’s
bus savings were between \$1.3 billion and \$577 million. It is based on
if the outsource was introduced this year and ran until at least 2040.
Savings would come from improving inefficiencies in labour productivity
and maintenance and use of rolling stock through a competitive tender
process. But it warns if more people start using the trains costs would
rise, reducing or eliminating any savings. It also pointed out the in
previous cases around the world there were examples of private operators
experiencing financial problems, due to contract issues and other
factors, which led to a disruption in services. Premier Annastacia
Palaszczuk said she didn’t believe Infrastructure Australia was
genuinely interested in building Cross River Rail.

## **Queensland Rail Citytrain stations**

On 25 May Queensland Transport Minister Jackie Trad announced a \$6
million for “minor upgrades”, including platform improvements, new
paint, and renewed signage at Park Road, Bowen Hills, Wacol, Goodna,
Manly, Murrarie, Windsor, Wilston and Beenleigh.

## **Badgerys Creek Airport**

The ALP has promised to build several rail links to Sydney’s new [second
major airport at Badgerys
Creek](http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/jetstar-set-to-call-badgerys-creek-home-under-alan-joyces-vision-for-qantas-operations/news-story/3630cd4a9bcb5c230a123d901c7d9355)
at a cost of \$400 million. On 26 April, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten
said the infrastructure was critical to encouraging jobs and growth in
Sydney’s west. He said he wants the new rail line to be ready on the
same day the airport opens in 2026. “A rail connection from day one is
critical.” In the first phase, Labor plans to [extend Sydney’s
South-West railway from Leppington via Bringelly to the new
airport](http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/badgerys-creek-airport-50-years-on-badgerys-creek-takes-off/news-story/abd7630b3e7a22da5b959e1d4c3bc2c6)
and will build a new outer orbital train line connecting the airport to
Macarthur in the south and St Marys in the north. It then would look at
building an outer orbital rail link connecting St Marys to the Sydney
Metro Northwest.

## **NSW passenger data available**

Transport for NSW has made Opal data available for the public on its
Open Data website, providing a detailed look into the ways passengers
use the state’s rail and public transport network. “Opal data has long
been one of our most requested and most useful datasets,” Tony
Braxton-Smith from Transport for NSW said. “Now it’s available, it means
researchers and developers can access and use the data like never before
to innovate and gain insights for a huge variety of benefits for
customers and organisations.”

Braxton-Smith said that one of the major benefits of the data release is
that businesses and governments can now plan and organise on the basis
of the empirical statistical evidence that provides, for instance, at
what times and how often stations and trains are being used by the
public. “Let’s say someone plans to open a business near a train station
and wants to establish the best times to be ready to serve customers
from this source. What was once an anecdotal, trial-and-error process
can now be backed up by hard data, which could help them succeed in
their business,” he said.

The Opal dataset was developed in partnership with the research network
Data61, which is part of the CSIRO, and with the University of
Technology Sydney and the Data Analytics Centre.

Braxton-Smith made clear that while the open data provides detailed
statistics of public transport use, it will not make public any personal
data. “[The data] has been de-identified and processed in a way that
protects the privacy of individual customers and has multiple levels of
security to prevent misuse,” he said.

The datasets can be viewed at

## **Sydney Trains: Airport trains**

On 14 May the NSW government has announced 200 extra train services each
week during non-peak times on the Sydney Airport line as demand
continues to grow. Transport Minister Andrew Constance and Sydney Trains
chief executive Howard Collins say services will double on weekends, to
a train roughly every seven-and-a-half minutes. Services will also be
boosted late on weeknights, when trains will run every 15 minutes. The
extra services, funded as part of a \$1.5 billion government investment
program, are expected to be introduced towards the end of the year.
Patronage of Sydney’s airport stations has increased by 32% in recent
years.

## **Sydney Metro draft timetable**

A proposed weekday timetable for the Sydney Northwest Metro has been
prepared. It would use 21 out of the 22 train sets in the fleet. One set
would be unavailable each day for a general inspection. The first
service from Cudgegong Road would depart at 0404 and from Chatswood at
0449. The last service from Cudgegong Road is proposed to depart at 2330
(Mon-Thu), and 0100 (Sat), and from Chatswood at 0015 (Tue-Fri), and
0145 (Sat). There is proposed to be six off-peak services per hour in
each direction, with the exception of late night services Friday night.
These would be 15 peak services per hour in each direction. The morning
peak period from Cudgegong Road would be from 0510 until 0900 (approx.)
and the afternoon peak period from Chatswood from 1550 until 1900
(approx.). Running time is 37 minutes.

## **JHR NSW CRN planning document – NSW Western line**

A new version of the John Holland Rail NSW Country Regional Network
document entitled *Possessions List – Major* mentioned in last month’s
*Table Talk* is now dated May 2017 to September 2018 and is available on
the JHR NSW CRN website at
<http://www.jhrcrn.com.au/what-we-do/network-operations-access/network-access-planning-performance/>
It seems that access to this document periodically disappears when an
updated version is being prepared, but it is still available by typing
“Possessions” into the website’s search facility.

The new edition indicates that around October new crossing loops are to
be constructed on the NSW main Western line at Rydal and Georges Plains.

## **Fletcher freight**

Fletcher International freight trains tri-weekly (Tuesdays, Thursdays,
Saturdays) from Dubbo to Botany, established to convey their chilled
meat for export, and subsequently expanded to also convey containerized
wheat, will soon again expand to carry cotton.

## **Canberra passenger trains**

The ACT Chief Minister, Andrew Barr, has called on the NSW government to
prepare a joint submission to the Federal government seeking money to
upgrade the Canberra line for faster speeds. Rather than pushing for an
elusive high-speed rail project, Mr Barr said he hoped the existing
tracks could be used, with modest upgrades, to host faster passenger
trains. He said it was an affordable option to improve the service. On
16 May, when the Chief Minister caught a train from Canberra to Sydney
to meet the NSW Transport Minister it was about an hour late because of
an earlier freight train failure, resulting in inevitable bad media
comment. The two governments agreed to make a joint review of the
railway with a view to modest upgrading.

## **Riverina passenger trains**

Councillor Vanessa Keenan of Wagga Wagga has advocated a daily passenger
train from Wagga to Albury and return. She said a reliable rail link
could help the cities share infrastructure, creating new opportunities
for business and draw people away from metropolitan areas.

Former Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. Tim Fischer AC, expanded this
with a call for a daily service between Griffith and Albury, saying it
would boost Riverina tourism while helping students and pensioners. Mr
Fischer suggested the train could include high quality food boxes
showcasing the MIA’s fresh produce, and be marketed as the “Griffith
Gourmet Express” as a means of attracting tourists. “A service departing Griffith at 7am and returning from Albury
at 4pm would be ideal for students, and those travelling for medical
appointments. It would benefit everyone, we’ve got the stations and rail
lines there, it wouldn’t take a lot for this to go ahead. The existing
weekly service between Griffith and Sydney could be scrapped, as this
new daily service would allow commuters to link up with express services
to major cities when in Wagga”, he said.

However, Peter Knox, president of Combined Pensioners Support Group,
thinks the main priority should be a second weekly train service to
Sydney, rather than a daily train to Albury.

## **Canberra Light Rail**

On 27 April the ACT government announced the names of stops along the
Canberra tramway. From north to south they will be Gungahlin Place,
Manning Clark North, Mapleton Avenue, Nullarbor Avenue, Well Station
Drive, EPIC and Racecourse, Phillip Avenue, Swinden St (stop for *Table
Talk* editorial address), Dickson Interchange, Macarthur Avenue, Ipima
St, Elouera St and Alinga St.

The project is on schedule, with the first track to be laid mid-year.
The first stage will open in late 2018.

On 27 April the ACT government appointed consultants to plan the second
stage from Civic (as the city is usually called in Canberra) to Woden
(ten kms), with a possible extension to Canberra Hospital (two more
kms). This will be about the same length as stage one, but more
complicated, as it will include the bridge over Lake Burley Griffin and
traverse areas of national significance. These sections will be catenary
free - a Federal government requirement.

## **Sydney Light Rail**

Potential names for stops on the Sydney tram lines, currently under
construction, have been announced. The line from Circular Quay to
Kingsford will have stops named Circular Quay, Metropolitan, Wynyard,
Queen Victoria Building, Town Hall, Chinatown, Haymarket, Central Grand
Concourse, Central Chalmers St, Surry Hills, Moore Park, E S Marks,
Kensington, UniNSW Anzac Parade, Kingsford and Nine Ways. The line to
Randwick from the junction (after Moore Park) will have stops at
Centennial Park, Wansey Cottage, UniNSW High St, and Randwick.

## **Metro Trains Melbourne: 27 August timetable**

From 27 August an additional morning and evening peak service will be
timetabled on each of the Craigieburn, Sunbury and Werribee lines,
adding capacity for 27,000 extra passengers during peak hours. In
addition, the 37 daily Newport-Altona-Laverton shuttles will be extended
into direct services between Laverton and Flinders St. All Craigieburn
line AM peak services will operate via the City Loop while some AM peak
services on the Sunbury line will run direct to Flinders St via Southern
Cross Two peak services along the Hurstbridge line are also getting
extensions – a Greensborough service will now start at Eltham and a
Heidelberg train from Greensborough.

An extra two minutes has been added to services on the Frankston line in
preparation for the opening of Southland station later this year.

Figures released by Public Transport Victoria from a May survey last
year revealed that 20% of morning peak hour trains were overcrowded.
Craigieburn and Sunbury lines had overcrowding levels of 50% and 40%
respectively.

The new train timetables will be available in July from

## **Victorian North East line**

Mr Fullerton, CEO, ARTC, advised a Senate Estimates Committee on 22 May
that “the north-east line is operating at the same standard as the rest
of the ARTC.” The XPT can travel at 130 kms an hour and the V/Line train
at 115, because it is limited by the capacity of the locomotive.

V/Line has claimed on-time running and reliability of Albury services
improved sharply in April, following major maintenance works. It
delivered 85.7% of services on time, up by 25% compared with March,
largely due to the lifting of several temporary speed restrictions after
ARTC completed upgrade works. The north-east line met its reliability
target in April for the first time since December 2016, with 96.7% of
services delivered, following the delivery of a refurbished additional
carriage set. A 12-month program is continuing to refurbish the three
other standard gauge trains.

A V/Line possession of the North Melbourne Flyover from 0030 Saturday10
June until 0345 Monday 12 June will result in:

-   NSW TrainLink substituting buses between Southern Cross station and
    Albury.
-   V/Line terminating services at Broadmeadows and providing buses from
    Broadmeadows to Southern Cross. V/Line services will run empty cars
    from Broadmeadows to South Dynon Loco and return.

## **V/Line: 27 August timetable**

On 9 May Premier Daniel Andrews and Minister for Public Transport
Jacinta Allan announced the 27 August V/Line timetable will provide 142
extra services every week:

-   Geelong line will get 69 additional services, including 30 new
    services at weekends – meaning trains at least every 40 minutes
    between 0700 and 1900 every day. Warrnambool trains will now have
    more express running between Geelong and Melbourne.
-   Bendigo, Ballarat and Gippsland will each get 18 extra weekly
    services.
-   Ararat line will get an extra up morning train and down afternoon
    train on weekdays, and
-   Shepparton will receive an extra train on Saturdays and Sundays.

The new timetables will be available in July from
[www.ptv.vic.gov.au](http://www.ptv.vic.gov.au).

## **V/Line: Seymour train**

From an unknown date, the 2150 weekday train from Southern Cross to
Seymour has departed at 2215, stopping at North Melbourne 2219u,
Broadmeadows 2234u, Craigieburn 2241u, Donnybrook 2247, Wallan 2258,
Heathcote Junction 2305, Wandong 2308, Kilmore East 2314, Broadford
2323, Tallarook 2332 and arrive at Seymour 2344.

## **V/Line: Echuca line**

Trains returned to the Echuca line commencing with the 1514 from
Southern Cross Station on Friday 19 May after the completion of a \$4.9
million program to improve detection at all active level crossings
between Echuca and Bendigo.

## **Metro Trains Melbourne: Mernda line**

On 27 April construction commenced on the extension of the South Morang
line to Mernda. This will serve one of Victoria’s fastest growing areas.
The project is for eight km of double track with three stations at a
cost of \$600 million. The Mernda extension is being delivered by the
Level Crossing Removal Authority.

## **Melbourne Metro tunnel**

The Melbourne’s Metro rail tunnel project has been enhanced by the
addition of high-capacity signalling from Sunbury to Pakenham, which
will run through the tunnel - allowing faster trains on the network.
However, this also increases the cost by \$131 million to a total of
\$11.03 billion. Public transport Minister, Jacinta Allan said, “We’re
designing, developing and implementing a trial of high-capacity
signalling as part of the Metro Tunnel project. This massive project and
next-generation high-capacity signalling will mean we can run more
trains more often and get people home safer and sooner.”

The proposal for a station at South Yarra as part of the Melbourne Metro
tunnel doesn’t stack up economically and offers no service benefit,
according to a business case by the Melbourne Metro Rail Authority.
Stonnington council, the Opposition and the Greens have all been pushing
the State government to include the station, and the Coalition has
pledged to build it if it wins next year’s state election. However, the
project’s business case, Infrastructure Victoria and the environment
effects statement have all recommended that South Yarra station should
not be included in the initial build. Melbourne Metro Rail Authority
chief executive officer Evan Tattersall says a station at South Yarra
would cost close to \$1 billion and offers little service benefit.

“With these five new stations, we’re building platforms to allow for
expansion of the new high-capacity Metro trains that are coming,” Mr
Tattersall said. “So with these really long platforms that you need for
these future 10-car sets, at South Yarra you would need a really long
straight platform. To do that given it’s such a constrained environment,
you could either have it as a complete underground station which would
cost an enormous amount of money or you could have the open-cut solution
where you take out Chapel St and half the Jam Factory. “Fine if you were
getting a huge train service benefit out of it — but you don’t. South
Yarra residents would still receive a train service every two minutes
once Melbourne Metro was complete, by freeing up capacity on the
Frankston and Sandringham lines. When we finish, we take the
Cranbourne/Pakenham line through the tunnel leaving us more space to run
more trains on the Frankston and Sandringham lines. This means they
still get a two-minute service, which any station in Melbourne would
love to have,” he said.

## **Melbourne flooding**

From Tuesday 25 April, Melbourne experienced very heavy rain for a
number of days, culminating in extreme rainfall on 26 April,
particularly in the eastern suburbs. There do not appear to have been
any cancellations of public transport services, but both Burnley and
Blackburn stations were closed for most of the day on account of
flooding in both underpasses. Blackburn was served by shuttle buses
between Blackburn and Nunawading; Burnley passengers were advised to
travel to Richmond station and change to/from the route 70 tram.

***Albert Isaacs*** *comments*: Interestingly, on-train recorded
announcements were changed to advise that the two stations were closed.
When I travelled on the Up from Box Hill on a train that was usually
tabled not to stop at East Richmond, the announcement had been modified
to say: “stopping all stations to Hawthorn; express Hawthorn to
Richmond; stopping all stations to Flinders Street”. Unfortunately, as
the train approached Burnley there was the normal announcement: “The
next stop is Burnley”, but the train did not stop.

Intriguingly, the fact that announcements on regular PTV services can be
modified to reflect changed conditions, is somewhat amusing when
compared with what happens on some of the additional trains operated by
Metro Trains. Metro Trains runs a number of extra trains (that is,
trains that PTV does not require them to run). In the morning
counter-peak (Down) there are a number of extras with a most unusual
stopping pattern: stopping all stations except East Richmond, Flinders
Street to Camberwell; express Camberwell to Box Hill; express Box Hill
to Ringwood. These are operated so as to form extra peak services to the
CBD. I usually travel on one of these services, twice a week. Strangely,
the abnormal running pattern is not reflected by the on-train VDUs,
which actually say: “Ringwood – stopping all stations except East
Richmond”. Nevertheless, both on-train announcements and station VDUs
contain the correct information!

I suspect that this unusual situation comes about because these services
are extra to the trains that Metro Trains are required by the PTV to
operate, and that for some reason only PTV has control over on-train
VDUs, but that Metro Trains can modify station VDUs and on-train
announcements. (Keep in mind, that there are no PTV services that
operate to the strange stopping pattern of these Metro Trains’ extras.)
Any further information on these strange inconsistences would be
welcomed.

## **Slow Melbourne trams**

Melbourne trams are among the slowest in the world, with an average
speed across the network of 16kmh. They spend more time stopped at
traffic lights than trams anywhere else. With three-quarters of the
city’s tram network operating on shared roads, 17% of journeys are spent
at red lights compared with the international standard of 2-5%.
Melbourne has about 170 kms of mixed traffic lanes where trams share the
road with motor vehicles. The closest to that is Toronto with 70 kms. A
VicRoads trial of part-time tram lane markings on Smith St in Fitzroy
improved the average journey time during morning peak by up to 54
seconds. Giving trams priority at traffic lights would make journey
times faster and more reliable, Yarra Trams says. In the CBD the average
speed drops to around 11kmh.

A trial with VicRoads this year will involve installing devices inside
trams and traffic signal boxes, to allow approaching trams to maintain a
green light.

Yarra Trams spokesman Simon Murphy said trams played a critical role in
keeping Melbourne moving and supporting major events. More than 1000
days of events per year require tram service changes. “Trams share the
city’s roads and traffic congestion is the leading factor affecting tram
performance,” he said. “Which is why we continue to work closely with
our on-road partners including VicRoads to find ways to make journey
times more reliable.”

Melbourne’s trams carried 204 million passengers in the 12 months to
June 2016.

## **Portland and Hopetoun lines freight disappears**

In October Iluka Resources will close its mineral processing plant at
Iluka Siding, seven kms south of Hamilton Victoria. This is because the
supply of mineral sands from the Victorian Murray Basin (between Sea
Lake and Kulwin) is exhausted. These sands – about 500,000 tonnes pa -
have been trucked to Hopetoun, then railed on V/Line tracks to Murtoa,
then on ARTC tracks to Iluka Siding on trains operated by Pacific
National thrice weekly (Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays). The plant also
processed mineral sands from near Ceduna, SA – about 100,000 tonnes pa.
These were trucked to Thevenard SA, shipped to Portland Victoria, then
railed to Iluka Siding. These trains too, were operated by Pacific
National thrice weekly (Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays). The SA mineral
sands will now be shipped to another Iluka plant at Narngulu near
Geraldton, WA.

The Portland and Hopetoun lines will, therefore, lose their regular
operation of freight trains, leaving only irregular grain traffic.
However, Iluka hopes to re-open the plant near Hamilton in 2019 when
mineral sands near Balranald NSW are exploited. It is expected that
these will be trucked to Hopetoun, then railed to Iluka Siding.

## **Pacific National dispute**

An industrial dispute between freight operator Pacific National and the
Rail, Tram and Bus Union delayed grain shipments in Victoria in April
and May. The Union advised of a three day strike over an unresolved
enterprise agreement, and, in return, the company locked train drivers
out for five days in early May.

## **Melbourne second port**

Infrastructure Victoria has assessed that Victoria doesn’t need a new
container port for another 38 years but, when it does, it should be
built near Geelong. Before then, the Port of Melbourne use will have
more than tripled, adding more trucks to the inner west and more
night-time freight traffic. It concludes that Bay West, between Geelong
and Werribee, would be the best location for any future port — rather
than the long-planned Hastings site. Chief executive Michel Masson said
Melbourne’s current container port, which was recently leased for 50
years for \$9.7 billion, won’t reach capacity until 2055. Port Phillip
Bay will need to be dredged to allow for larger vessels into Webb and
Swanson docks. The report said the Bolte Bridge and Melbourne’s road
network of bridges will need to be strengthened, so it can handle bigger
trucks, and the Port of Melbourne will also need to be reconfigured so
its capacity could be boosted.

The report has also called for an increase in freight trucks overnight,
which will raise the ire of inner-west residents. The issue of trucks
travelling through residential areas will need to be addressed before
any substantial increase of freight traffic, the report warned. “We
heard during consultation that some local residents feel the Port of
Melbourne’s operation is not complementary with surrounding land uses,
and has a social impact on nearby residents,” it says. The Port of
Melbourne now handles 2.6 million containers a year and has a capacity
of about 4.4 million.

Detailed planning for a new container port will not be required until
2040, but the report estimates Bay West would require about a \$6
billion investment to become a large second container port — while
Hastings would cost more than double. Infrastructure Victoria said Bay
West has strong transport, land use, environmental and amenity
advantages, when compared with Hastings. The report says the Port of
Hastings would be more suited to handling car freight and not container
ships.

Minister for Ports Luke Donnellan said the Infrastructure Victoria
advice would be part of the government’s freight strategy to be released
later this year.

## **Adelaide Metro: Gawler electrification**

On 10 May the SA government called tenders for stage one of
electrification of the Gawler line as far as Salisbury at a cost of
\$152 million. Major construction works will start in early 2018 and
will include installation of:

-   Overhead wiring system including masts and gantry supports,
-   A new signalling system,
-   An Automatic Train Protection system,
-   A new fibre optic communications system cable, and
-   Protective works and modifications to existing infrastructure.

## **Adelaide Metro & ARTC: Torrens Junction**

Trains on the Outer Harbor and Grange lines were suspended from 29 April
until 7 May for the first stage of work to provide grade separation
between Adelaide Metro passenger and ARTC freight lines at Torrens
Junction. Currently, traffic is delayed for more than two hours every
day at the junction, as passing freight trains close crossings for up to
six minutes each time. When completed, freight trains will no longer
need to give way to the passenger trains, reducing delays to the freight
service and to the road network.

During the closure, temporary rail lines were constructed for Gawler,
Outer Harbor and Grange passenger services, while construction began on
a new bridge at Park Terrace and Gibson St. Piling works were also
carried out from the River Torrens to Torrens Rail Junction, and at
Bowden. The project is costed at \$238 million.

As part of the Torrens Rail Junction Project, the city bound platform at
Bowden station was closed from 12 April until the end of October, in
preparation for the future lowering of the Outer Harbor line.

## **Iron Road project**

On 3 May the SA government approved the \$4.5 billion Iron Road project
on the Eyre Peninsula, subject to environmental conditions. If the
company meets the conditions, the project will be Australia’s largest
magnetite mine, estimated to produce 21.5 million tonnes each year. The
project will include the construction of a new 148 km heavy-haul railway
and deep-water port at Cape Hardy, near Tumby Bay. The port could also
be used to export other goods from the region, such as grain.

## **Transperth Timetable Guide**

***David Whiteford*** *writes:* I’ve frequently reviewed this guide, the
last appearing in November 2016 *Table Talk*. The latest issue is
effective 23 April 2017 to coincide with the Aubin Grove (Mandurah line)
station opening and some bus route reorganisation. I sent a copy of my
last review to the Public Transport Authority as there were recurring
errors and omissions and I’m pleased to report that some of my points
have been addressed in the new issue. Butler is now shown as served by
the Joondalup railway timetable; Muchea has been deleted; Cardup now
shows the correct TT21; and the WA Museum, Perth, is shown as closed
until 2020.

The Butler railway extension opened 21 September 2014 and it took until
23 April 2017 before the railway timetable was shown against it. Why
then, when this new guide shares its date with the opening of Aubin
Grove, is the Mandurah Line TT not listed against Aubin Grove? The Aubin
Grove station is actually just over the boundary of its namesake suburb
and is in Atwell (eastern entry) and Success (the main western entry)
and so they, too, could have Mandurah line listed against them. The
other major change made was the inclusion of Cockburn Central in the
suburb list – an omission I’d not picked up previously. Cockburn Central
is a dedicated suburb in its own right as well as a railway station.

## **Whim Creek iron ore project**

Balla Balla Infrastructure Group is exploring exploitation of iron ore
deposits at Whim Creek in WA’s Pilbara region. The project is dependent
on iron ore prices. If it proceeds, there will be a 162 km railway to a
new port at Balla Balla. The project is costed at \$5.6 billion.

## **Somewhere you will never travel**

Albanian Railways, HSH, have restored passenger services, albeit only
with three trains a day. Samuel Rachdi has produced a timetable of these
new Albanian trains, along similar lines to his other timetables of East
European railways, see
<http://www.fahrplancenter.com/HSH%202017%2031032017.pdf> Copies are
available from the June ATA Distribution List.

# **ODD SPOT**

The shortest international passenger train service in the world is from
Woodlands, Singapore to Johore Bahru, Malaysia. It is only four
kilometres long and takes just five minutes (plus all the time for
international formalities). Trains operate 12 times a day. The advantage
of the service is that it avoids the notorious traffic congestion on the
road crossing between the two countries. The disadvantage is that
Woodlands station is not near a Singapore Mass Rapid Transit station,
and requires a bus connection. For details, see table 6001 of the
*European Rail Timetable*.

# **BUS NEWS**

## **Australian Capital Territory**

**ACTION:** The Westfield Belconnen Bus Station was closed from 4 until
10 May to allow pavement upgrades. There were no changes to services.

## **New South Wales**

The **NSW Transport Info** has introduced a totally new website with new
format timetables where each route has a PDF - it still has a lot of
bugs.

**Sydney Buses**: On 15 May Andrew Constance, NSW Minister for
Transport, announced that State Transit bus services operated by
Burwood, Leichhardt, Kingsgrove and Tempe Depots would be put out to
private tender. The tender process will commence in July this year and
the successful tenderer will run services from July 2018. Buses and
depots will remain owned by government who will continue to set
timetables and fares. The government said a high level of complaints
because of an unreliable service as the reason. Many commuters see
traffic congestion as the reason for a poor service and this will not
change with private operators. Drivers at the affected depots said they
were not consulted about privatisation and already had assurances from
the Minister that State Transit’s contract would be renewed for Inner
West services. The drivers held a strike on 18 May. Limited services
were provided on 438 from Railway Square to Five Dock and 461 Railway
Square to Burwood Depot using private buses. In the same week the
government announced that the new City-Mona Vale Limited Stops B-Line
due to commence at the end of 2017 would be operated by State Transit,
rather than a private operator as indicated in preliminary plans.

Busabout buses and drivers were borrowed by Transport for NSW to provide
emergency assistance in the strike. However, this resulted in the
cancellation of many Busabout services. Hillsbus, Interline, Busways and
Transdev are also reported to have assisted but information is not
known.

From 24 April, route **294** has two trips each weekday between Lane
Cove and Wynyard during the morning peak using larger ‘bendy’ buses.

State Transit Lane Cove area changes effective 4 June

-   New route 530 between Chatswood and Burwood via Lane Cove and Five
    Dock. This service will run from early morning to late evening,
    seven days a week with buses every 20 mins during peak periods and
    every 30 minutes at other times. With M40 Chatswood-Bondi Junction
    via Town Hall or 200 Chatswood-Bondi Junction via Macquarie St,
    Sydney (peak hour) and 400 Bondi Junction-Burwood via Airport or 418
    Bondi Junction-Burwood via Sydenham a complete circle service now
    exists.
-   Route 536 Chatswood-Gladesville will be reduced to a peak service
    being replaced at other times by 530 between Chatswood and Lane Cove
    West and 252 City-Lane Cove West now extended to Gladesville.
-   In addition to the two extra trips each weekday on route 294,
    further additional trips are: 285 City-Mars Road (ten extra services
    a week), 252 Lane Cove West-City (60 extra services), 292
    City-Marsfield (ten extra services), 518 City-Macquarie Uni (50
    extra services) and 506 City-East Ryde (30 extra services extended
    from East Ryde to Macquarie Uni).
-   265 Lane Cove to McMahons Point via Greenwich now terminates at
    North Sydney.
-   Routes 430 and 495 no longer operate due to low patronage.
-   There are new timetables for routes

**Forest Coach Lines** took over Ryans Coffs Harbour to Grafton route
372 in November 2016 and **Sawtell Coaches** routes 362, 362W, 362C, 363
and 364 on 1 April 2017. Since then some of Ryans buses have been
repainted into Forest livery, but it is uncertain whether they still
operate as Ryans or Forest. The new format timetables on Transport.info
still show Ryan and Sawtell Coaches respectively.

(Forest Coach Lines have run buses since 1930 in the northern Sydney
region, and in 2014 completed the sale of a majority share of the
operations to Next Capital, a long time investor in international bus
operations. It is managed by CEO and third generation family member
David Royle.)

**Busabout** Route **841** Narellan to Leppington has additional and
altered routes in Gledswood Hills from Sunday 30 April. This includes
new weekend and weekday services and night journeys until 2300. Hourly
weekend services have been introduced to 2000 Saturdays and 1800
Sundays. The 841 route has also been altered in Gledswood Hills to
operate along the newly opened The Hermitage Way. Both inbound and
outbound services now operate a clockwise loop via The Hermitage Way,
right Fairbank Drive, right Lillydale Avenue, continuing via the former
route.

**Blue Mountains Transit** introduced a new timetable for route 690K on
24 April. The 1500 from Springwood station now departs at 1515. The 1628
from Katoomba Parke St now departs at 1617. Westbound services from
Springwood now divert into Queens Road from 0900. Westbound services to
Katoomba CBD now divert to Katoomba Hospital from 0900. Eastbound
services from Katoomba divert through Genivieve Bay from 0900. 690K no
longer serves the bus stop at Great Western Highway opposite Woodlands
Road, Katoomba. There are some minor adjustments to other routes.

**Hillsbus alterations** from Monday 8 May: Route **635**: An additional
morning service leaves High Road at 0810 to Beecroft station. Route
**641**: An additional morning service leaves Dural Round Corner at 0704
to Rouse Hill Town Centre.

Route **637**: Service leaving Glenorie Shops at Old Northern Road at
0736 now departs at 0735, heading to Pennant Hills station. ***Lourie
Smit*** *comments*: Only one minute difference, but the new timetable has
a footnote: Bus commences from Old Northern Road after Timaru St at
0731, whereas the old one had commenced from Les Shore Oval three
minutes earlier.

New timetables have been issued.

**Busways** Changes effective 28 May

-   **751** Blacktown to Marsden Park via Colebee: Most services
    extended along Alderton Drive to service the new Greenway Living
    Estate, including three new bus stops on Alderton Drive. Most route
    751 services now run to/from Marsden Park.
-   **783** Penrith to Jordan Springs is extended along Sinclair Parade,
