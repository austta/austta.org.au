title: ATA Timetable News
---
The Bulletin Board which was used by this website until October 2003 is unfortunately no longer available.
The following alternatives are now available:

* Timetable news may be posted to the Australian Transport Discussion Board at [www.busaustralia.com/forum](http://www.busaustralia.com/forum/).
You do not need to be a member to read messages from this board but you must be a member to write messages to the board. Also members of the board can use extra facilities such as messaging between members.
There are separate sections for timetable information for each state.
News on this board is retained for a number of weeks after the last reply to the message has been posted.

* Alternatively any news to update any of the timetable lists in this website may be [emailed to us](mailto:webmaster@austta.org.au) or to any email address which may be shown on the list concerned.

Items posted on the board above or emailed may be used in the Association's timetable news magazine *Table Talk*.
