## Sydney
**Sydney meeting dates have changed again!** – to the third Saturday of February, May, August and November. Therefore the next Sydney meeting will be held at 1400 on Saturday 16th August 2016 at Level 5, Room 5040, Abercrombie Building (H70), The University of Sydney Business School, Corner Codrington and Abercrombie Streets, Darlington. This is a fantastic meeting place and attracted a record attendance in May – or perhaps it was the home&#8209;made chocolate cake.

**How to get there:** Bus to City Road near Butlin Avenue (400 metres) or train to Redfern Station (800 metres), enter up ramp on Codrington Street then take lift or stairs to level 5,  <Geoffrey.Clifton@sydney.edu.au>.
