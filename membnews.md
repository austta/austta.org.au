### The National Timetable Collection Workshop Has Moved!

January 5 began a new chapter in the work on ATA projects in Melbourne. On this day the move of all the NTC boxes, ATA archives and furniture from Hawker, our previous base at South Yarra, to Hookina was completed. Hookina is our name for Unit F24 at Kennards Self Storage, 1317 North Rd, Huntingdale, a short walk east from Huntingdale Station. Hookina is the next station after Hawker on the Commonwealth Railways former narrow-gauge railway. Six ATA members were involved in the move.

Our regular working bees commenced at Hookina from Saturday 8 January, nominally from 10.00am to 4.00pm with a break for lunch at about 1.00pm. At this stage the working bees will be held each Saturday. There will also be working bees on some Thursdays. Initially, there was some unpacking and reorganisation to do in the Hookina storage unit, but normally the working bees will be conducted in the spacious Meeting Room that is provided free of charge. The Meeting Room is adjacent to a spacious kitchen where tea and coffee is available free, and there is a fridge and microwave that can be used on the day. The Huntingdale shopping centre is 2 blocks away with plenty of take-away food options. We will resume work on sorting through the various collections we have received, selecting and cataloguing the timetables for the NTC, and storing or discarding any duplicates. If you can help on any particular day, can please let Len Regan (0409&nbsp;209&nbsp;114) know so that we can plan ahead and get a specific project ready for you. Every reasonable precaution is being taken to provide a Covid safe working environment. Our unit is F24, on the ground floor, close to the Meeting Room where we will be doing our regular work.

### The Year Ahead

2022 appears to be a relatively quiet year for transport developments. However, we can expect the opening of the new Forrestfield-Airport Rail Line in Perth. New stations will be provided at Redcliffe, Airport Central and High Wycombe. The bus network will be reconfigured to feed the new line. In NSW reviews of bus networks in Queanbeyan and Lismore are underway. This follows new networks already implemented in Tweed Heads (December 2019), Wagga Wagga (March 2020) and Bathurst (June 2021). On April 3 Transdev John Holland will takeover State Transit’s bus network in Sydney’s eastern suburbs. This is the last of the four Sydney regions previously operated by State Transit to be privatized.

### Relocation of The National Timetable Collection

Due to congestion for storage and workspace at PMI, and to respect the COVID-19 work restrictions, alternative premises were obtained at 14 Wilson St, South Yarra, and the Collections and Archives were moved there on 24 April 2021. Our premises were part of a former Call Centre with desks and chairs provided. These premises have been called Hawker; a name taken from the next station after Wilson on the Commonwealth Railways former narrow-gauge railway. These premises were acquired by a new owner on 14 December 2021 who plans to demolish the building. New Storage for the National Timetable Collection has been found at Kennards Storage at Huntingdale from 29 December, and the NTC and Archives will be moved there on 5 January 2022. At Huntingdale ATA has rented a space six metres by three metres. We also have access to conference rooms, a communal kitchen, and a bathroom. Our storage facility is 500 metres from Huntingdale Station and a range of eateries are nearby. It is planned to call the new facility Hookina, a name taken from the next station after Hawker on the Commonwealth Railways former narrow-gauge railway.

### 2022 Annual General Meeting Sydney Tramway Museum

Sunday 16 October 2022 has been set as the date of the 2022 ATA Annual General Meeting. The Sydney Tramway Museum is situated adjacent to Loftus Station. Our program will commence from 10.30am. For a cost of $15 per participant we will be provided with a museum tour, unlimited tram rides and the use of a conference space at the Sutherland substation. The substation also houses several exhibits. Lunch is planned for 12.30pm at Café 2232 Loftus, on the other side of the station. Our AGM will commence at 2pm at the substation. Participants are welcome to join at any time during the day.

### Stephen Gray Memorial Distribution Service

Hopefully the January list will be of great interest. It contains two sets of Melbourne printed bus timetables effective September 2021. Printed timetables also cover Transperth bus services effective 10 October 2021 and recent Transwa bus timetables. Some Perth Metronet Project brochures are also available. There are also links to many online bus and ferry timetables covering Ballarat, Rural SA, Rural NSW, Interstate Greyhound timetables and Far North Queensland and other services. In the recent December List, the Sydney Trains working timetables proved popular along with items detailing recent Sydney South-Eastern bus service changes effective 5 December 2021.
