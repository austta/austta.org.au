## Committee Meeting
The next ATA Committee Meeting will be on 4th August, just before the AGM. If you have material which you wish to put before the Committee, please contact the ATA Secretary, Victor Isaacs on <abvi@iinet.net.au>.

## Annual General Meeting
This year, the ATA AGM will be held in Brisbane on 13th August. On this weekend, the Brisbane Ekka will be taking place, which means more intense Public Transport to observe. It also means that travel and accommodation bookings will be harder to get â€“ so book early. The Brisbane Division is in the process of organizing a number of tours and visits in association with this meeting. More details and official documents will be included in the July mail-out.

## Membership renewal
Last month we dispatched renewal notices for the 2016-2017 Financial Year. Many members have already renewed, but it would help to get more in sooner rather than later, to allow our National Treasurer to properly frame his budget. The deadline is 30th June and members who have not renewed by the 23rd of June will receive and e-mail reminder. We will print the July magazines for everyone on the assumption that they will renew. Only those who have paid by June 30th will actually receive the full mail-out as usual.
