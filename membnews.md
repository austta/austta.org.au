The June List will feature Newcastle Transport bus timetables effective 3 April 2022, Transperth bus timetables, Melbourne PTV bus timetables and Picton Buslines timetables.

There will be a Sydney Division Get-Together over lunch at the Tradies, the Sutherland & District Trade Union Club, on Saturday 25 June at 12.30pm. Tradies is situated at 57 Manchester Rd Gymea, enter from Kingsway. Tradies is a 5-to-10-minute walk from Gymea Station via Gymea Bay Rd and Kingsway and has ample parking.

### Report on ATA Committee Meeting Wednesday 18 May 2021

The ATA Committee met on Wednesday 18 May 2021. Below under various headings are details of matters dealt with at the recent meeting.

#### Treasurer’s Report

Income year-to-date is $13377, expenses are $17168, giving an accrual deficit of $3791, compared with a deficit of $2353 twelve months ago. The main reason for the increased deficit in this period is the greater cost of rental. Membership revenue received so far for 2021-22 is $7507, $128 less than at the same time in 2020-21. Donations are becoming an important part of our income: $1561 has been received so far this year. Monthly mailout costs have been $2545, which is $5344 less than for the same period last year. This reflects the change from commercial printing in Sydney to volunteer printing in Melbourne. Mailout postage costs have declined by $341. Compared with the same period last year, the surplus from the Distribution List is $312 greater, but from the Auctions it is $682 less.

#### Bank Account Changes

As ING were discontinuing small accounts it became necessary for ATA to move our investment account. As the Bendigo Bank were offering a competitive interest rate, our term deposit was transferred from ING. Also, our cheque account was transferred to Bendigo Bank from Westpac. Please update your electronic banking details: **Bendigo Bank BSB 633-000. Account 192546489.**

You can now make payments to ATA using **Pay ID.** The PayID for ATA is its ABN: **74 248 483 468**. This is the simplest and safest way when using on-line banking. You select PayID, enter the ABN number (without spaces), and you will get confirmation that the payment is going to the Australian
Timetable Association. You do not need to remember or use the BSB and account number.

#### Writers needed for “The Times”

“The Times” our journal of historical articles and analysis requires articles. Geoff Lambert, editor of “The Times”, says all sorts of articles are welcome. Relevant timetables which accompany the articles are of interest. An Authors’ Guide is available on our website at [www.timetable.org.au](https://www.timetable.org.au/times.html) .

#### Possible New Premises for ATA

 As it is unsustainable financially to remain at Kennards Huntingdale where the storage and working spaces are small, there is an urgency to find new premises. Darebin Council in north-central Melbourne invited us to inspect a former community health centre in Reservoir to assess its suitability for the ATA’s archives projects. This inspection took place on 28 April 2022, and the consensus is that it would be suitable. A submission has been sent to Darebin Council outlining our proposed use of the building, in accord with the Council’s requirements for a community lease. The property is at 89 Hughes Parade, Reservoir, a 20-minute walk from Keon Park Station. On 31 May Darebin Council advised that “The Australian Timetable Association has formally submitted a proposal to Darebin City Council requesting to lease one of its buildings. Council are considering the proposal however are yet to respond formally”.

#### Website Redevelopment

Transit Graphics have resumed work on development of the ATA’s website. The design of the website has been completed and paid for. Transit Graphics is now working on the setting up the website to replace the current website. Members of the Website Development Group have been given access to the new website as work on its development progresses. We will be advised when we are able to make comments. ATA portfolio officers will need to add text to the new website. When this work is completed, Transit Graphics will become the host for our website.

#### Agreement between ARHS and ATA

Discussions have been held between our Treasurer, Len Regan, and James Dalton, Manager, The Railway Archives, Australian Railway Historical Society. It is anticipated that both organisations will share timetable catalogues, surplus printed timetables, and digitised timetables. ARHS has extensive equipment and volunteer resources for digitising timetables. Any requests to obtain or purchase digital timetables will be forwarded to ARHS.

#### 2022 Annual General Meeting Sydney Tramway Museum

Just a reminder that Sunday 16 October 2022 has been set as the date of the 2022 ATA Annual General Meeting. The Sydney Tramway Museum is situated adjacent to Loftus Station.

## May 2022

### Membership Renewal 2022 – 2023

Normally a Membership Renewal form for the following financial year is sent with the May mailout. However, these will be sent out in the June mailout this year as ATA is changing bank accounts and we expect this to be finalized by the beginning of June. Membership fees for 2022-2023 are $72 for normal Australian membership, $108 for overseas membership, $66 for membership with only electronic mailout and $36 for students. All members with an email address will also receive a Membership Renewal form by email – this caters for those who prefer the print version or email version.

### Stephen Gray Memorial Distribution Service

The April Distribution List has received nine orders at the time of writing. Eight of these included orders for printed PTV bus timetables in the Frankston and Cranbourne regions effective February 2022, exhausting our supplies. Our thanks to Matthew Gibbins for obtaining and distributing these timetables. The May List will have Sydney Trains Easter Show working timetables and V/Line Easter and Anzac Day working timetables. In addition, there will be historic American train timetables from New York and Philadelphia and historic London Underground and bus maps. These historic timetables were supplied by Derek Scrafton.

### Progress on the National Timetable Collection

The search for permanent premises continues. David Cranney, Agnes Boskovitz, John Kain, Jim Stokes, Peter Clark and Dale Budd have continued to meet regularly in Canberra to catalogue Victor Isaacs’ collection of timetables. A few boxes of Victorian material and bus timetables from all States have recently been received at Huntingdale as a result of this work. Geoff Hassall (Newcastle), Joel Taggart and Joe Hicks (Adelaide) have also volunteered to start cataloguing specific material. Richard May, Steven Haby, Geoff Mann and David Hennell are working on cataloguing in Melbourne.

### Timetable Alert

We have previously included lists of recent electronic timetables in the Distribution List. However, this did not produce much interest and sometimes the links provided had changed by the time the list was published. In consultation with Len Regan, Steven Haby and Chris Pandlilovski a similar listing has now been provided in “Table Talk” under the heading Timetable Alert. In the April “Table Talk” Timetable Alert listed new Newcastle Transport timetables effective 3 April 2020. In the May issue Translink Gold Coast timetables 9 August 2021 reissued in the new neon pink colour scheme are listed as well as March 2020 Greyhound timetables. Timetables can be downloaded from the appropriate website.

## April 2022

### Assistance Required for Cataloguing the National Timetable Collection

The Association is preparing the National Timetable Collection to be housed at the State Library of Victoria. This will involve receiving timetables donated from private collections and sending them to a place where they can be publicly accessed. This will be of interest to those doing historical research to see the extent and frequency of public transport at various times. It could also be of assistance to those researching their family history and even cold crime cases! Victorian members have worked on sorting and cataloguing the National Timetable collection at ATA premises at Prahran, South Yarra and now Huntingdale, and at home. Some Sydney members had a session before the 2020 Covid lockdown. If you are interested in cataloguing timetables for the NTC individually or with other members please contact Len Regan, <archives@timetable.org.au> or 0409&nbsp;209&nbsp;114. Len can send you some timetables to catalogue and arrange for instruction for the computer cataloguing process.

### Stephen Gray Memorial Distribution Service

The March Distribution List has received over twenty orders. The Sydney Trains and NSW Trains working timetables and rosters received much interest as well as printed Melbourne Metro and V/Line commuter and regional timetables. Limited stock items from Switzerland, Slovakia, Romania, United Kingdom, and Germany have also received orders. The April List will have PTV bus timetables effective 13 February 2022 in conjunction with the new Cranbourne & Pakenham Line and Frankston Line timetables.

### Online Timetables

Australian transport organizations provide online timetables of varying usefulness. Translink Queensland, Transperth, Adelaide Metro, Metro Tasmania, Transport Tasmania, and Transport Canberra have electronic timetables in a format similar to former printed timetables. Thus, they can be readily printed at home if required. However, many Transperth timetables have very smaller print when reduced to A4 for printing. PTV online timetables show every stop and can be cumbersome on screen and lengthy to print. For instance, the 246 Clifton Hill to Elsternwick timetable comprises twenty-seven pages. The route maps are generated on demand and could not be printed. A big plus is the PTV app which on opening can show the times for all transport modes departing shortly from your current location. The print on demand timetables provided in our distribution service show major stops and have a good route map. The Transport for NSW online bus timetables only show a single route and a number of timetables are necessary to find your next bus in a common corridor. For instance, the 100 City-QVB to Taronga Zoo timetable is 22 pages in length. However, it does have a helpful route map which details the common corridor routes 228, 229, and 230 from Milsons Point and 100, 243, 246, 249 from Sydney City.

## March 2022

### Membership Fees are Changing

The Association’s annual Membership Fee of $60 has remained unchanged since 2011 – that’s 11
years without any increase. Due to inflation, $60 in 2011 is the same as $75 today. ATA is also taking
into consideration actual and possible future postage increases in the next 12-18 months. Thus,
an increase in fees is inevitable. The Committee debated this at its meeting on 16 February 2022 and has
decided that this time has now come.

In recent years, the Association has embarked on some major projects including the National Timetable Collection and upgrading its website. It has invested funds in a computer system, and it has to pay rent to store its timetable collections and archives. It has retained the quality production each month of The Times and Table Talk magazines and continues to provide a monthly Distribution List and Auction.

A new schedule of membership fees will apply from 1 July 2022 and will be included in the Membership Renewal forms sent out in May 2022. A discount on the normal fee will be available for those who receive the monthly mailouts by email rather than by post. This is the new fees schedule.


| | Annual | Monthly
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Australian Member| $72  | $6.00 |
| Australian Member with only email mailout  | $66 | $5.50 |
| Australian Student Member (aged under 25 years) | $36 | $3.00 |
| International Member  | $108 | $9.00 |
| International Member with only email mailout  | $66 | $5.50 |

With full colour and electronic links, the electronic versions of our magazines are of a higher quality compared with the print versions. At present our printed magazines are only in black and white and even when ATA has its own printer our printed magazines will only have a limited number of coloured pages. In the long run savings on postage, stationery and administration costs will be of great benefit.
While there will be a reduction in mailout printing costs when members switch to digital mailout, a reduction in postage costs may not occur immediately due to the arrangements for Print
 Post. Accordingly, the discount for digital mailout may need to be reviewed in future years.

## February 2022

### The National Timetable Collection Workshop Has Moved!

January 5 began a new chapter in the work on ATA projects in Melbourne. On this day the move of all the NTC boxes, ATA archives and furniture from Hawker, our previous base at South Yarra, to Hookina was completed. Hookina is our name for Unit F24 at Kennards Self Storage, 1317 North Rd, Huntingdale, a short walk east from Huntingdale Station. Hookina is the next station after Hawker on the Commonwealth Railways former narrow-gauge railway. Six ATA members were involved in the move.

Our regular working bees commenced at Hookina from Saturday 8 January, nominally from 10.00am to 4.00pm with a break for lunch at about 1.00pm. At this stage the working bees will be held each Saturday. There will also be working bees on some Thursdays. Initially, there was some unpacking and reorganisation to do in the Hookina storage unit, but normally the working bees will be conducted in the spacious Meeting Room that is provided free of charge. The Meeting Room is adjacent to a spacious kitchen where tea and coffee is available free, and there is a fridge and microwave that can be used on the day. The Huntingdale shopping centre is 2 blocks away with plenty of take-away food options. We will resume work on sorting through the various collections we have received, selecting and cataloguing the timetables for the NTC, and storing or discarding any duplicates. If you can help on any particular day, can please let Len Regan (0409&nbsp;209&nbsp;114) know so that we can plan ahead and get a specific project ready for you. Every reasonable precaution is being taken to provide a Covid safe working environment. Our unit is F24, on the ground floor, close to the Meeting Room where we will be doing our regular work.

### The Year Ahead

2022 appears to be a relatively quiet year for transport developments. However, we can expect the opening of the new Forrestfield-Airport Rail Line in Perth. New stations will be provided at Redcliffe, Airport Central and High Wycombe. The bus network will be reconfigured to feed the new line. In NSW reviews of bus networks in Queanbeyan and Lismore are underway. This follows new networks already implemented in Tweed Heads (December 2019), Wagga Wagga (March 2020) and Bathurst (June 2021). On April 3 Transdev John Holland will takeover State Transit’s bus network in Sydney’s eastern suburbs. This is the last of the four Sydney regions previously operated by State Transit to be privatized.

## January 2022

### Relocation of The National Timetable Collection

Due to congestion for storage and workspace at PMI, and to respect the COVID-19 work restrictions, alternative premises were obtained at 14 Wilson St, South Yarra, and the Collections and Archives were moved there on 24 April 2021. Our premises were part of a former Call Centre with desks and chairs provided. These premises have been called Hawker; a name taken from the next station after Wilson on the Commonwealth Railways former narrow-gauge railway. These premises were acquired by a new owner on 14 December 2021 who plans to demolish the building. New Storage for the National Timetable Collection has been found at Kennards Storage at Huntingdale from 29 December, and the NTC and Archives will be moved there on 5 January 2022. At Huntingdale ATA has rented a space six metres by three metres. We also have access to conference rooms, a communal kitchen, and a bathroom. Our storage facility is 500 metres from Huntingdale Station and a range of eateries are nearby. It is planned to call the new facility Hookina, a name taken from the next station after Hawker on the Commonwealth Railways former narrow-gauge railway.

### 2022 Annual General Meeting Sydney Tramway Museum

Sunday 16 October 2022 has been set as the date of the 2022 ATA Annual General Meeting. The Sydney Tramway Museum is situated adjacent to Loftus Station. Our program will commence from 10.30am. For a cost of $15 per participant we will be provided with a museum tour, unlimited tram rides and the use of a conference space at the Sutherland substation. The substation also houses several exhibits. Lunch is planned for 12.30pm at Café 2232 Loftus, on the other side of the station. Our AGM will commence at 2pm at the substation. Participants are welcome to join at any time during the day.

### Stephen Gray Memorial Distribution Service

Hopefully the January list will be of great interest. It contains two sets of Melbourne printed bus timetables effective September 2021. Printed timetables also cover Transperth bus services effective 10 October 2021 and recent Transwa bus timetables. Some Perth Metronet Project brochures are also available. There are also links to many online bus and ferry timetables covering Ballarat, Rural SA, Rural NSW, Interstate Greyhound timetables and Far North Queensland and other services. In the recent December List, the Sydney Trains working timetables proved popular along with items detailing recent Sydney South-Eastern bus service changes effective 5 December 2021.
