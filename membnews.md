## March 2020

## Report of the ATA Committee Meeting Wednesday 20 November 2019

Our meeting comprised the usual reception of reports on the work of the ATA. For the first seven months of the 2019-2020 financial year, our bank balance has been in a healthy position due to the renewal of memberships. The distribution list and auction have been running at a surplus. Our work has been impacted by increased costs for postage and printing. Membership fees are unchanged for 2020/21, so normal membership will be maintained at $60. Membership is now 134 and we welcome Robin Bromby of Edgecliff, NSW as a new member. In recognition of the assistance given to ATA by Samuel Rachdi of Fahrplancenter, Switzerland we will offer him free membership for 2020/21. Samuel has been able to provide ATA members with many overseas timetables. Matthew Gibbins and Richard May are assisting in the preparation of auction catalogues. They join Len Regan, Geoff Hassall and Robert Henderson as well as other volunteers in the work of the auction. Early in January 2019 we submitted an application for $15000 under the Local History Grants Program to cover the costs of computer, printer, book scanner access and storage shelving in a new work area for the Victorian Segment of the National Timetable Collection. Scanning hard-bound working timetables is being done by members at Docuvan in Bayswater, Victoria. Remember the date for the AGM to be held in Sydney is Saturday August 15, 2020.

## Melbourne & Sydney National Timetable Collection Working Sessions

Melbourne Working Sessions will be held on Saturdays 7 & 21 March, 4 & 18 April, Thursdays 12 & 26 March, 9 & 23 April at Prahran Mechanics’ Institute 39 St&nbsp;Edmonds Rd, PRAHRAN.

## January 2020

### The Year Ahead

The hope with which we usually start a New Year has been adversely affected with the devastation of horrendous bushfires across many states. We would hope that our members, their families and friends are safe at this very difficult time.
2019 brought the opening of new light lines in Newcastle, Canberra and Randwick (Sydney) as well as the Chatswood to Tallawong (Sydney) Metro. The Kingsford branch of the Sydney Light Rail Network is due to open in March 2020 with a recast of South East bus routes to take place four to six weeks later. When the new bus network is in operation it will be interesting to see the extent to which routes operating past Randwick or Kingsford will continue to operate to and from the CBD in light of the slow journey times being experienced on the tram. On 5 January, 2020 the Carlingford (Sydney) rail line closed for conversion to light rail as part of the Parramatta Light Rail Line due to commence operation in 2023. Meanwhile in Perth a recasting of bus routes in the Mirrabooka and Wanneroo Road areas is planned for 2020. This will provide better connections between new residential areas, train stations and business centres.

### National Timetable Collection Report

Included in the January Mail Out is very important report on the National Timetable Collection prepared by Len Regan. ATA members are encouraged to support this project.
