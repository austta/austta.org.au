## January 2020

### The Year Ahead

The hope with which we usually start a New Year has been adversely affected with the devastation of horrendous bushfires across many states. We would hope that our members, their families and friends are safe at this very difficult time.
2019 brought the opening of new light lines in Newcastle, Canberra and Randwick (Sydney) as well as the Chatswood to Tallawong (Sydney) Metro. The Kingsford branch of the Sydney Light Rail Network is due to open in March 2020 with a recast of South East bus routes to take place four to six weeks later. When the new bus network is in operation it will be interesting to see the extent to which routes operating past Randwick or Kingsford will continue to operate to and from the CBD in light of the slow journey times being experienced on the tram. On 5 January, 2020 the Carlingford (Sydney) rail line closed for conversion to light rail as part of the Parramatta Light Rail Line due to commence operation in 2023. Meanwhile in Perth a recasting of bus routes in the Mirrabooka and Wanneroo Road areas is planned for 2020. This will provide better connections between new residential areas, train stations and business centres.

### National Timetable Collection Report

Included in the January Mail Out is very important report on the National Timetable Collection prepared by Len Regan. ATA members are encouraged to support this project.
