### ATA Zoom Meeting Saturday 12 June 14:00 AEST

The Sydney Division will be hosting another ATA Zoom meeting on Saturday 12 June from 14:00 to 16:00 AEST (13:30 from SA, 12:00 from WA). All are welcome to join this meeting. We held a successful meeting last year and we look forward to seeing you again. On the day, open the link <https://uni-sydney.zoom.us/j/87000110044> on your browser to join the meeting but you will need to have the Zoom client installed first <https://zoom.us/download>. Please contact Geoffrey Clifton at <geoffrey.clifton@sydney.edu.au> or [0405&nbsp;387&nbsp;478]([tel:+61405387478]) for help on getting online. You can also join the meeting by phone, audio only. Contact Geoffrey or myself for details. The Sydney Division will be hosting our Annual General Meeting later in the year. Details are yet to be finalized.

### New premises for National Timetable Collection

We applied for a lease of the empty building at Windsor Station in September 2020. However, the only response so far from VicTrack is that our proposed use of the building is acceptable. We had certainly planned and budgeted to have moved from our current premises at PMI by now. The situation at PMI is such that we had to move to new premises as soon as possible.

* The space available is not adequate to securely store all the NTC stock and ATA archives.
* It is difficult to undertake NTC cataloguing in the space available.
* The space is needed by the Victorian History Library.

In the search for new temporary premises, pending a permanent outcome with VicTrack at Windsor Station, Steven Haby found premises nearby at 14-16 Wilson St South Yarra. They have been inspected by the NTC volunteers and deemed to be suitable. The secure brick building was previously used as an internet call centre, but the staff are now working at home. The desks and facilities are still available. A lease for a period of six months has been obtained. The NTC and ATA Archives were moved to the new location on 24 April 2021. Our thanks to the NTC team.

### Membership Renewal 2021 – 2022

With this May mailout you have received your Membership Renewal for 2021-2022. A prompt renewal is always appreciated. Membership fees remain the same as last year: $60 for normal membership and $36 for students. Members who are having financial hardship can pay a concessional membership of $30. All members with an email address will receive a Membership Renewal form by email – this caters for those who prefer the print version or email version.

### ATA Auctions

Auction 137, Railway DVDs, adopts a simpler bidding format. Details are in the Auction Catalogue.
Initial planning is underway for a Live Auction by Zoom, conducted by Albert Isaacs, possibly in late October 2021. Please think about this opportunity for you to submit **QUALITY MATERIAL** you may wish to sell by Auction. More details will be included in the June 2021 Members News.

### Update on National Timetable Collection

With the COVID-related hiatus in activity now behind us, working bees for the National Timetable Collection have recommenced at Prahran this year. A total of 12 people have so far been able to continue the sorting and culling of the many timetables now in our possession. It is hoped that work to sort and catalogue bus timetables that was started earlier last year by a small group in Sydney can also restart soon. Cataloguing of railway working timetables from NSW and Victoria has been recently completed and these are now almost ready to be lodged with the State Library of Victoria.
Recent sorting has also enabled us to have a large number of additional timetables ready to be catalogued. The process of cataloguing can be completed by anyone who has access to a computer and no special computing skills are necessary. Timetables can be sent to those interested in helping with this work so that the work can be completed from home. Training and advice can be readily provided by phone or email. Please contact Len Regan if you are interested in helping with any aspect of the National Timetable Collection or simply interested to know more about any aspect of the project.

### Update on Distribution Service

The February List received twenty-eight orders with the Metro Melbourne working and public timetables, Adelaide Seaford and Tonsley Lines train timetable, and Ventura, Melbourne bus timetables popular. The March List has received twenty orders with the Sydney Trains and NSW Trainlink working timetables popular along with the regional Victoria bus timetables from Bendigo, Geelong, Sale and Kilmore/Seymour/Wallan. David Whiteford has supplied sets of recent Transperth bus timetables and these are available in the April List. In addition, Michael Marshall has obtained a good number of the recent Melbourne bus timetables from PTV for the April List. Also,for the April List, Alex Sims has provided complete sets of current Adelaide Metro bus timetables (except already provided City Connector service) and some superseded timetables. Although the proposed new Adelaide bus network has not been implemented recent bus timetables effective 5 July 2020 and 26 January 2021 reflect repositioning of bus stops and time changes on the current network.

### Report on ATA Committee Meeting Wednesday 17 February 2021

The ATA Committee met on Wednesday 17 February 2021. Committee member Steven Haby was able to organize a meeting by Zoom. Our thanks to Steven. Below under various headings are details of matters dealt with at the recent meeting.

### Membership Fees Unchanged for 2021-2022

Given current circumstances and the good financial position of the Association it was agreed that membership fees should remain unchanged. Members are free to make an optional donation to the Association when renewing membership. Thus, membership fees will remain at $60, $36 for students.

### New Members

We welcome two new student members Joe Hicks and Matthew Schoepf of Adelaide. They have a strong interest in South Australian timetables.

### Simplification of Auction Procedures

Consideration is being given to a possible simplification of the current Auction procedures. The
main change being considered is to replace the Minimum and Maximum bids with a single bid. The
catalogue would show an estimate of the Lot’s value which is slightly higher than the Reserve
price. In recent times, some Auction bidders have been submitting only one bid, which has been
deemed to be both a minimum and maximum bid. The suggested changes would overcome this
problem and would allow a simpler management of future auctions and access to additional auction
sources. Some features of the current auction process, which are well established and acceptable,
would be retained. Comments on the suggested changes are encouraged, and these can be sent to
Auctioneer Geoff Hassall at <auction@timetable.org.au> or by phone to [0432&nbsp;291&nbsp;791](tel:+61432291791).

### Website Development

The committee has accepted the offer of Melbourne member Matthew Gibbins to assist with our website development and has appointed him as our Website Development Manager. As members of our website development committee were either stretched for time or had limited understanding of the technology it was decided to hand the process over to a member who had the skills and time to drive the process forward. Matthew will work closely with the ATA executive and committee.

## February 2021

### Changing Networks

With only a few weeks between the deadlines for the January and February mailouts, there is no more ATA news to report for the February Members’ News. Thus, I will do some commentary for this Members’ News. I hope this is of interest.

Looking at Metropolitan Transport Trust Perth, Bus and Ferry Guides dated September 1971 and September 1972 you can see changes to Perth to Morley via William St services. In 1971, the William St corridor was served by routes 60 (Morley), 61, 62 & 63 (North of Morley) and 56 (Lockridge). In September 1972, the Morley Bus Station opened, and the network was reconfigured with 60 Perth-Morley (High Frequency All Stops) and new 66 Perth-Morley (Peak Hour Express), whilst 56, 61, 62 and 63 became feeder services. This has been a continuing pattern in Australia and New Zealand over the last fifty years.

As Canberra developed transport hubs were developed in the CBD, Woden, Belconnen and Tuggeranong. Prior to 1999, the high frequency route 333 required passengers to change at an interchange. Since 1999, network refinements meant buses continued through interchanges into outer suburbs to provide a one-seat journey from the CBD. This continues in the current Canberra network.

This principle of high frequency services with accompanying hub and spoke bus networks has been promoted by American transit consultant Jarrett Walker. We see this in Sydney’s new Lower North Shore and Northern Beaches network, effective 20 December 2020, with 244 City-Chowder Bay, 245 City-Balmoral, 247 City-Mosman Junction and 430 City-Taronga Zoo being combined into high frequency 100 QVB-Taronga Zoo. Chowder Bay is served by new 111 from South Mosman Wharf via Mosman Junction. Balmoral is served by new 114 from Royal North Shore Hospital.

From 2016 to 2018, network reviews across Auckland progressively introduced a high frequency network. This implementation was successful with local buses feeding high frequency trains and buses. Many lengthy bus routes were replaced by a faster train connecting with a short local bus journey. In 2018, a frequent bus network was implemented in Central Wellington, New Zealand. This resulted in passengers travelling on what was previously a relatively short route having to change to reach the CBD. In 2020, these changes were reversed with passengers preferring an hourly frequency with no need to change, to a half-hourly frequency with a change.

### The Year Ahead

On behalf of the ATA committee, our best wishes to our members and friends for 2021. Fortunately, due to the diligent work of our journal, distribution service and auction teams our monthly mailout continued during 2020. Hopefully, this will continue in 2021. In general, at the time of writing our Brisbane, Adelaide and Canberra divisions may meet regularly in 2021. However, Sydney and Melbourne division meetings and work on the National Timetable Collection will depend on any Covid restrictions in place at the time. Although some worthwhile work on our website redevelopment has taken place by a committee, further progress will require one or two people to drive the process further. We are still awaiting the result of our application to VicTrack for a Community Lease for the vacant building at Windsor Station, Melbourne. If successful, this building will accommodate the continuing work on the NTC. The Distribution Service still receives a good number of orders for New South Wales and Victorian working train timetables. The Distribution Service may receive up to ten orders for the bus timetables Michael Marshall receives from PTV. Four members regularly order Transperth bus timetables, which are provided by David Whiteford. Transperth train timetables receive a few more orders. Metro Hobart, Hobart Launceston, Tassielink and Busways have supplied printed timetables. These received six to seven orders. A contact from Hobart Metro emailed to point out that timetables are available on their website. As timetables are not printed or only printed in small quantities, current printed material will not be readily available on 2021 Distribution Lists.

Looking further afield across the nation Sydney will have new North West and Lower North Shore bus routes and timetables in January 2021. Already M10 and M50 services to Maroubra Junction and Coogee have been discontinued along with UNSW Express services 891 893 and 898. These alterations may foreshadow further changes to the Eastern Suburbs bus network. Melbourne will have new train timetables from 31 January offering more metropolitan and regional services. In late 2021 the new Forrestfield-Airport rail line is due to open in Perth. This is scheduled to be followed by the opening of the Yanchep extension to the Joondalup line, and Byford extension to the Armadale line in 2022. In 2021 work will continue to complete the Gawler line electrification in Adelaide. Devonport, Burnie and North West Tasmania will have new bus networks commencing on 17 January.
