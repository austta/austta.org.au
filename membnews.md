## January 2021

### The Year Ahead

On behalf of the ATA committee, our best wishes to our members and friends for 2021. Fortunately, due to the diligent work of our journal, distribution service and auction teams our monthly mailout continued during 2020. Hopefully, this will continue in 2021. In general, at the time of writing our Brisbane, Adelaide and Canberra divisions may meet regularly in 2021. However, Sydney and Melbourne division meetings and work on the National Timetable Collection will depend on any Covid restrictions in place at the time. Although some worthwhile work on our website redevelopment has taken place by a committee, further progress will require one or two people to drive the process further. We are still awaiting the result of our application to VicTrack for a Community Lease for the vacant building at Windsor Station, Melbourne. If successful, this building will accommodate the continuing work on the NTC. The Distribution Service still receives a good number of orders for New South Wales and Victorian working train timetables. The Distribution Service may receive up to ten orders for the bus timetables Michael Marshall receives from PTV. Four members regularly order Transperth bus timetables, which are provided by David Whiteford. Transperth train timetables receive a few more orders. Metro Hobart, Hobart Launceston, Tassielink and Busways have supplied printed timetables. These received six to seven orders. A contact from Hobart Metro emailed to point out that timetables are available on their website. As timetables are not printed or only printed in small quantities, current printed material will not be readily available on 2021 Distribution Lists.

Looking further afield across the nation Sydney will have new North West and Lower North Shore bus routes and timetables in January 2021. Already M10 and M50 services to Maroubra Junction and Coogee have been discontinued along with UNSW Express services 891 893 and 898. These alterations may foreshadow further changes to the Eastern Suburbs bus network. Melbourne will have new train timetables from 31 January offering more metropolitan and regional services. In late 2021 the new Forrestfield-Airport rail line is due to open in Perth. This is scheduled to be followed by the opening of the Yanchep extension to the Joondalup line, and Byford extension to the Armadale line in 2022. In 2021 work will continue to complete the Gawler line electrification in Adelaide. Devonport, Burnie and North West Tasmania will have new bus networks commencing on 17 January.
