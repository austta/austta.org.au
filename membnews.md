### Report on ATA Committee Meeting Wednesday 17 February 2021

The ATA Committee met on Wednesday 17 February 2021. Committee member Steven Haby was able to organize a meeting by Zoom. Our thanks to Steven. Below under various headings are details of matters dealt with at the recent meeting.

### Membership Fees Unchanged for 2021-2022

Given current circumstances and the good financial position of the Association it was agreed that membership fees should remain unchanged. Members are free to make an optional donation to the Association when renewing membership. Thus, membership fees will remain at $60, $36 for students.

### New Members

We welcome two new student members Joe Hicks and Matthew Schoepf of Adelaide. They have a strong interest in South Australian timetables.

### Simplification of Auction Procedures

Consideration is being given to a possible simplification of the current Auction procedures. The
main change being considered is to replace the Minimum and Maximum bids with a single bid. The
catalogue would show an estimate of the Lot’s value which is slightly higher than the Reserve
price. In recent times, some Auction bidders have been submitting only one bid, which has been
deemed to be both a minimum and maximum bid. The suggested changes would overcome this
problem and would allow a simpler management of future auctions and access to additional auction
sources. Some features of the current auction process, which are well established and acceptable,
would be retained. Comments on the suggested changes are encouraged, and these can be sent to
Auctioneer Geoff Hassall at <auction@timetable.org.au> or by phone to [0432&nbsp;291&nbsp;791](tel:+61432291791).

### Website Development

The committee has accepted the offer of Melbourne member Matthew Gibbins to assist with our website development and has appointed him as our Website Development Manager. As members of our website development committee were either stretched for time or had limited understanding of the technology it was decided to hand the process over to a member who had the skills and time to drive the process forward. Matthew will work closely with the ATA executive and committee.

### Changing Networks

With only a few weeks between the deadlines for the January and February mailouts, there is no more ATA news to report for the February Members’ News. Thus, I will do some commentary for this Members’ News. I hope this is of interest.

Looking at Metropolitan Transport Trust Perth, Bus and Ferry Guides dated September 1971 and September 1972 you can see changes to Perth to Morley via William St services. In 1971, the William St corridor was served by routes 60 (Morley), 61, 62 & 63 (North of Morley) and 56 (Lockridge). In September 1972, the Morley Bus Station opened, and the network was reconfigured with 60 Perth-Morley (High Frequency All Stops) and new 66 Perth-Morley (Peak Hour Express), whilst 56, 61, 62 and 63 became feeder services. This has been a continuing pattern in Australia and New Zealand over the last fifty years.

As Canberra developed transport hubs were developed in the CBD, Woden, Belconnen and Tuggeranong. Prior to 1999, the high frequency route 333 required passengers to change at an interchange. Since 1999, network refinements meant buses continued through interchanges into outer suburbs to provide a one-seat journey from the CBD. This continues in the current Canberra network.

This principle of high frequency services with accompanying hub and spoke bus networks has been promoted by American transit consultant Jarrett Walker. We see this in Sydney’s new Lower North Shore and Northern Beaches network, effective 20 December 2020, with 244 City-Chowder Bay, 245 City-Balmoral, 247 City-Mosman Junction and 430 City-Taronga Zoo being combined into high frequency 100 QVB-Taronga Zoo. Chowder Bay is served by new 111 from South Mosman Wharf via Mosman Junction. Balmoral is served by new 114 from Royal North Shore Hospital.

From 2016 to 2018, network reviews across Auckland progressively introduced a high frequency network. This implementation was successful with local buses feeding high frequency trains and buses. Many lengthy bus routes were replaced by a faster train connecting with a short local bus journey. In 2018, a frequent bus network was implemented in Central Wellington, New Zealand. This resulted in passengers travelling on what was previously a relatively short route having to change to reach the CBD. In 2020, these changes were reversed with passengers preferring an hourly frequency with no need to change, to a half-hourly frequency with a change.

## January 2021

### The Year Ahead

On behalf of the ATA committee, our best wishes to our members and friends for 2021. Fortunately, due to the diligent work of our journal, distribution service and auction teams our monthly mailout continued during 2020. Hopefully, this will continue in 2021. In general, at the time of writing our Brisbane, Adelaide and Canberra divisions may meet regularly in 2021. However, Sydney and Melbourne division meetings and work on the National Timetable Collection will depend on any Covid restrictions in place at the time. Although some worthwhile work on our website redevelopment has taken place by a committee, further progress will require one or two people to drive the process further. We are still awaiting the result of our application to VicTrack for a Community Lease for the vacant building at Windsor Station, Melbourne. If successful, this building will accommodate the continuing work on the NTC. The Distribution Service still receives a good number of orders for New South Wales and Victorian working train timetables. The Distribution Service may receive up to ten orders for the bus timetables Michael Marshall receives from PTV. Four members regularly order Transperth bus timetables, which are provided by David Whiteford. Transperth train timetables receive a few more orders. Metro Hobart, Hobart Launceston, Tassielink and Busways have supplied printed timetables. These received six to seven orders. A contact from Hobart Metro emailed to point out that timetables are available on their website. As timetables are not printed or only printed in small quantities, current printed material will not be readily available on 2021 Distribution Lists.

Looking further afield across the nation Sydney will have new North West and Lower North Shore bus routes and timetables in January 2021. Already M10 and M50 services to Maroubra Junction and Coogee have been discontinued along with UNSW Express services 891 893 and 898. These alterations may foreshadow further changes to the Eastern Suburbs bus network. Melbourne will have new train timetables from 31 January offering more metropolitan and regional services. In late 2021 the new Forrestfield-Airport rail line is due to open in Perth. This is scheduled to be followed by the opening of the Yanchep extension to the Joondalup line, and Byford extension to the Armadale line in 2022. In 2021 work will continue to complete the Gawler line electrification in Adelaide. Devonport, Burnie and North West Tasmania will have new bus networks commencing on 17 January.
