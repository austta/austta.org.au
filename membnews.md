The AGM was held at the Brisbane Tramway Museum Ferny Grove on Saturday August 13, 2016. About twenty people where present including museum staff and family members.

The committee members come from Sydney, Newcastle, Adelaide, Canberra and Yea. Peter Hobbis did not seek re-election. However, Peter continues as the Distribution List Manager. We thank Peter for his contribution to the committee. Geoff Hassall no longer wishes to act as auctioneer but will receive and process bids until a new auctioneer is found. Len Regan will dispatch items to successful bidders for the time being. We thank Geoff for being our auctioneer for several years. We welcome Alex Sims to the committee. The Adelaide Division have been invited to host the AGM and Roger Wheaton is to consult with other Adelaide members, otherwise the next AGM will be in Sydney as per the usual rotation.
