# The Association:
The ATA was founded in 1983 as the AATTC to promote interest in transport timetables around the world. The Association has members in all Australian States and Territories, as well as active members in Europe, Asia and the USA.
**We are a non-profit organisation**.

# Constitution:
The constitution of the Association is [available online](Modelrules.pdf). (86kB ![PDF](https://efb778d9cbba3f4c5d31-2a2416132ea09b6c13760470ead1b56d.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/pdficon.svg))

# Magazines
* [<span class="TimesLogo">The Times</span>](times.html): Articles of research into and review of historical timetables and current transport scheduling trends. [Have a read now!](times.html)
* [<span class="TableTalkLogo">Table Talk</span>](ttalk.html): The latest available news of timetable and transport happenings from within Australia and around the world. [Have a read now!](ttalk.html)

These magazines not only provide news, but enable members to keep in contact through "Letters to the Editor" and the "Traders Items" column.

# Timetable Distribution
The Association runs a **_Timetable Distribution service_**. This is an excellent way to get copies of transport timetables from around the world. Timetables, maps, brochures and related material gathered by members and sent to our Distribution Service are made available to members at a nominal charge to cover postage and administration. The monthly members mailout contains a Distribution List which itemises the material available that month. These items are usually current timetables, but occasionally historic items appear also.

# Ted Downs Memorial Timetable Auctions
Monthly ATA **_Auctions_** offer members the opportunity to buy and sell some rare and historic timetable and related material. A link to the most recent Auction Catalogue is shown on the home page.

# Meetings
Semi-regular ATA [meetings](meetings.html) held in Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne and
Sydney, offer members the opportunity to meet others who share an interest in
Timetable matters, and to catch up with the latest news. These meetings usually
include the opportunity to take home interesting timetables from "**_grab boxes_**" to which many members contribute.

# Newsletters
The President publishes [newsletters](membnews.html) from time to time - the most recent issue is available on line.
