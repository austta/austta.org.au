## **TOP TABLE TALK - WESTERN SYDNEY**

### New metro between Sydney CBD and Parramatta?

A new metro line between Sydney City and Parramatta has been suggested as the next possible major public transport project initiated by the NSW government. Planning is believed to be underway. The line would bring relief to Sydney's Western rail corridor and service growth areas, such as the Bays Precinct around Rozelle and the former industrial lands at Camellia. The project could also include a future expansion to Badgerys Creek airport to the west, and is likely to also contemplate an eastward expansion to Maroubra and Long Bay. But one option being considered is cutting back the scope of the proposed light rail line between Parramatta and Strathfield via Olympic Park.

The line could possibly be included in the Transport for NSW masterplan,
due for release in 2017. But the pressures and the thinking behind the
project stretch back decades. A metro line between Parramatta and the
city, extending to the eastern suburbs, was included in former
director-general for rail [Ron Christie's
report](http://103.4.17.5/christie/christie.pdf) into the Sydney train
system in 2001. And proposals for a "west metro" project and an eastern
extension were also [developed under former Labor Premier Morris
Iemma](http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/new-sydney-tunnel-proposal/2007/09/13/1189276899575.html)
in 2007, though subsequently scrapped.

As well as relieving the Western line, the proposal would support the
government's land and housing agenda. The chief executive of UrbanGrowth
NSW, responsible for the Bays Precinct development, has said that [the
project would be a
"disaster"](http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/major-sydney-development-a-disaster-without-new-transport-project-boss-20150826-gj7zc3.html)
without major new public transport.

NSW Transport Minister Andrew Constance said on 7 September there was
"no doubt that there is going to be the need for additional rail
capacity" between Parramatta and the City in the longer term.
However, the government has made no decision about western metro –
let's be clear on that. There is some private sector interest out there,
absolutely," he said. "But what is going to motivate a future decision
around this is actually the capacity of the existing T1 Western rail
line, because it reaches full capacity by 2030 – you can't put any more
people on the trains." The Baird government has promised to increase the
number of trains running each hour by two to 20 on the western line by
2019 "to try to build capacity into a very constrained rail line". "That
is our focus at the moment but, given the growth in the city's west, the
realistic long-term outcome is going to have to be considered," he said.

The Western line is the busiest on Sydney's rail network. The most
recent government statistics show [average loads on the line in the
morning peak
increased](http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/overcrowding-on-sydneys-trains-worsens-for-passengers-during-morning-peak-20160524-gp2la2.html)
21% to 134% between September 2014 and September 2015. Passengers begin
to suffer from overcrowding when trains have loads of 135%, which is the
benchmark used by transport officials.

A joint state and federal discussion paper into western Sydney's rail
needs is also expected to be released soon. It will canvass a wide range
of rail options including the possibility of a link to the proposed
Badgerys Creek Airport which is due to open in 2025. While not wanting
to pre-empt the paper, Mr Constance said: "I have always felt that
connectivity from cities out west to the airport is probably the
number-one priority in terms of the future success of the airport."

Transport for NSW have released a discussion paper on rail options for
western Sydney at <http://www.westernsydneyrail.transport.nsw.gov.au/>
They are looking for comment from the public. It is possible to download
the 6.5Mb report which then allows you to read and interpret it at
leisure before responding in whatever way. Submissions on the discussion
paper close on 28 October.

### **Badgerys Creek Airport: Rail access**

On 16 September, Federal Minister for Urban Infrastructure Paul Fletcher
released an options paper for rail access to Badgerys Creek Airport in
Western Sydney. One proposal envisages an ultra-modern train capable of
speeds of up to 160km/h for 30,000 passengers an hour to the City in 27
minutes. This would require a tunnel between the CBD and Parramatta,
with stops at the Bays Precinct and Olympic Park. The single-deck
configuration would then link Parramatta to Badgerys, a journey taking
just 15 minutes.

Funding models would need to be developed. Options for infrastructure
bonds and private sector involvement may be available. The study reveals
that the most expensive option could cost close to \$25 billion. The
report cites the direct rail option as providing the quickest link
between the two CBDs of Sydney and Parramatta, as well as connecting to
the new airport at Badgerys.

Other options include a link between Badgerys and the southwest rail
link with a travel time to the CBD of 55 minutes, or linking the airport
to the Sydney Metro Northwest, which would give commuters a 35-minute
ride from the northwest to the airport. Further options include a direct
link between the airport and Liverpool, or a link between the airport
and the Western Line at St Marys — a 48-minute trip between Badgerys and
the CBD. There is also an option for a north-south link between
Macarthur and St Marys via the new airport.

Converting Sydney's existing airport train line between Central and
Revesby to single-deck metro trains is an option. The possibility of
separating the Airport Line from the suburban network, and running a
metro-style shuttle, emerged in an options paper prepared by the state
and federal governments referred to in the preceding item. This could
allow an extra 12 trains an hour from the outer south-west to operate on
the congested City Circle Line, the paper found.

Mr Fletcher said communities will be able to have their say in the final
decision on the rail options. Submissions close on 28 October. The
federal Labor opposition, which also backs the construction of the
airport, has said rail options must be a prerequisite for the airport.

# **RAIL AND TRAM NEWS**

### **Australian transport forecast**

Australia’s transport sector has recovered after the impact of the
Global Financial Crisis with the nation’s freight task likely to grow by
26% over the next decade according to a new research report published on
9 September by the National Transport Commission (NTC). The [Who Moves
What Where
report](https://www.ntc.gov.au/Media/Reports/%28D62E6EFC-36C7-48B1-66A7-DDEF3B04CCAE%29.pdf)
provides information about the nature of Australia’s freight and
passenger movements, and will help those involved in infrastructure,
planning and investment, operational improvements and regulatory
changes. The report forecasts that over the next decade:

-   Domestic freight will increase by 26% and
-   Domestic passenger movements will increase by 19%.

### **ARTC: Inland Rail project**

Macquarie Bank has been awarded a contract to advise the Federal
government on its proposed Inland Freight Rail Project. Macquarie's role
is expected to consider private funding options, including a
public-private-partnership and other structures, and test the ideas more
generally with the private market. The Federal government is seeking
private sector interest in the design, construction, delivery and
financing of the Inland Rail project. ARTC has also sought expressions
of interest for technical engineering and environmental approval
services for the project.

The Federal Government has invited companies to register interest in the
design, construction, delivery and financing of the project. ARTC is
seeking expressions of interest for technical engineering and
environmental approval services.

### **Great Southern Rail: Future**

Sixteen months after purchasing a 70% controlling share in Great
Southern Rail, Allegro Funds has sold this to Quadrant Private Equity
for \$200 million. Under Allegro ownership, GSR doubled its earnings by
emphasising the tourist appeal of the Indian Pacific and Ghan. There
remains a number of administrative matters to complete, but the
transaction is expected to be finalised in mid-October. Established in
1996, Quadrant's investments cover retail, healthcare, media, consumer
foods, financial services and other sectors.

### **Queensland Rail CityTrain: Kippa-Ring line opening 4 October**

The railway from Petrie to Kippa-Ring opened on Tuesday 4 October. On
the preceding day, Queen’s Birthday holiday in Queensland, there were
free trains. The timetable is available online at
<http://translink.com.au/about-translink/projects-and-initiatives/moreton-bay-rail-link>
The off-peak frequency is every 30 minutes; more frequently in peaks.
Most trains run through from Kippa-Ring to Springwood Central and v.v.
On Mondays to Fridays there will be one train all the way from Rosewood
(0730) to Kippa-Ring (0945). Caboolture trains now all run express
Petrie-Northgate-Eagle Junction-Bowen Hills. Altered train services and
the new bus network were outlined in the proposals reported in the
December 2015 *Table Talk*.

### **Queensland Rail CityTrain: Central station**

Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk on 5 September announced a \$67
million, three year revamp of Brisbane Central station. The upgrade will
provide a new roof, which will extend over the Edward Street end of the
concourse, and modernisation of the platforms, including ceiling, wall
and floor treatments and lighting, level entry boarding, extended cover
on platforms 2/3 and 3/4, and new passenger information displays and
seating. New lifts will be installed, along with an additional escalator
from the concourse to ANZAC Square, to reduce congestion during peak
periods. There will be improved staff facilities.

### **Sydney Trains: System enhancements**

A new turnback, west of Parramatta, will be commissioned on the weekend
of 15/16 October.

Control of signaling on the Eastern Suburbs line and Erskineville
Junction was transferred to Sydenham signaling centre on the weekend of
15/16 October.

Wynyard Walk, an 800 metre walkway between Wynyard station and the
Barangaroo development, opened on 20 September.

### **Sydney Trains: 17 October timetable**

The following improvements will be introduced from Monday 17 October:

**T4 Eastern Suburbs and Illawarra line:** Three additional all stops
trains between Bondi Junction and Hurstville in the PM peak, doubling
the number of departures from Central between 1515 and 1545. The new
services will enable four existing Cronulla and Waterfall bound services
to stop at fewer stations, resolving crowding and reducing journey times
for by up to eight minutes.

**South Coast line:** More frequency, capacity and reduced journey times
on Illawarra line services between 1515 and 1545. Four express services
stopping at Austinmer Station will be permanently introduced into the
timetable following a recent review.

**Blue Mountains line:** The 1518 from Central to Lithgow will operate
as an eight car train instead of a four car train, doubling the number
of seats.

NSW Minister for Transport and Infrastructure Andrew Constance said,
“Travel patterns are changing. There are now more day trippers, school
children and those working flexible hours who want to leave the city
earlier so a big part of these improvements are to cater for the
changing needs of customers. We will continue to monitor the network to
identify where we can deliver further improvements to current services.”

### **ARTC WTT 16 October**

A new Working Timetable for ARTC has been issued with effect from 16
October (as predicted in last month’s *Table Talk*). It can be accessed,
as usual, on their website at
<http://www.artc.com.au/customers/operations/mtp/2016-06-12/> The new
WTT includes new times of GSR’s Ghan, but not new times of the Indian
Pacific.

### **ARTC: Southern line**

ARTC conducted a large number of minor civil engineering works along the
NSW Southern line from Moss Vale to Albury from 2 until 6 September.

ARTC provides the following graph of the effect of speed restrictions on
the Southern line since track, mainly ballast, problems became apparent
in 2012, and since the remedy program was implemented:

### **Aurizon: Botany-Enfield shuttles**

In early September Aurizon commenced operation of a shuttle from the
Port of Botany to Aurizon’s intermodal facility at Enfield, western
Sydney. Initially, the service is operating six times a week, with plans
to increase over the medium term to accommodate customer demand.

### **Wagga2 freight hub**

The contract for an upgrade of the Wagga Wagga freight hub was signed in
late August. The first stage involves the construction of a grade
separated underpass of the Main Southern Railway and will improve
vehicular movement between the Terminal, the Olympic Highway, the
existing Bomen Industrial precinct and Byrnes Road. The broader project
is likely to also see the delivery of grain terminal facilities, a
container terminal and rail infrastructure, ensuring this region is able
to thrive and survive. Works are expected to be completed by mid-2017.

### **Canberra Tram**

On 1 September the ACT government announced the second stage of its
light rail network will go to Woden, making a major pre-election play by
taking its flagship infrastructure project to Canberra's south. The
planned 11-km route will take trams across Lake Burley Griffin via the
Commonwealth Avenue bridge, through the Parliamentary Triangle, and down
Adelaide Avenue to the Woden town centre. The route, at this stage, will
not extend to Mawson. It is being dubbed the "north-south spine", a long
light rail network stretching from Gungahlin to Woden, which will
integrate with rapid and local buses, later tram stages, and other
transport options to service the rest of the city.

Building from the City to Woden is expected to cost roughly the same as
from Gungahlin to the City, given the similar distances, although no
detailed costing work has yet been done and a business case is not yet
complete. The government has consulted and conducted pre-feasibility
studies on stage two, but says a business case will not be ready until
next term. Contracts are planned to be signed during the next term of
government.

The path south is not without its challenges. Commonwealth Avenue Bridge
[may require
strengthening](http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/labor-will-choose-one-of-four-tram-extensions-to-start-building-in-next-term-of-government-20160721-gqaj9c.html),
and will at least require comprehensive structural assessments. It will
also require the approval of the federal planning authority, the
National Capital Authority, for the portion of the route that travels
through the Parliamentary Triangle. The NCA has already signalled that
overhead lines should not be used through the triangle, and Labor, if
re-elected, would quickly begin talks with the Authority to address
concerns it may have.

The route services national land and federal public service buildings,
giving the ACT government a better bargaining position when it asks the
Federal government to continue funding the project in its second stage.
Labor hopes that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's generally supportive
position on public transport and transformative infrastructure may help
convince the Federal government to open its wallet, if he is still in
power.

It remains unclear whether work would start immediately following the
completion of stage one in 2018-19, although the government is keen to
ensure there is minimal delay between the stages to ensure its
employment pipeline continues.

### **Victorian vision**

The Rail Futures Institute presented a report on 5 September advocating
construction over a 25 year period of:

-   A high speed railway from Melbourne to Geelong,
-   A Geelong-Ballarat-Bendigo standard gauge line,
-   High speed upgrades,
-   Upgraded stations,
-   Quadruplication from Caulfield to Dandenong,
-   Electrification to Bacchus Marsh, with quadruplication from Sunshine
    to Melton,
-   A high speed railway to Melbourne Airport, partially in tunnel, and
    extending via Clarkfield to the Bendigo line, and via Wallan to the
    Seymour line.

The Rail Futures Institute is an independent, non-partisan group formed
to advocate sustainable rail solutions for public transport and freight
problems with a membership of rail professionals, engineers and
economists.

### **Victorian present**

Stage one of the Murray Basin rail project was completed in August with
more than 175,000 new sleepers and 34 km of new rail on the
Mildura-Yelta and Hopetoun lines. Stage two has begun involving
conversion to standard gauge to Yelta and Murrayville, plus re-opening
of the Maryborough-Ararat line. The main work will involve the closure
of the Yelta and Murrayville lines for seven months from August 2017.
Stages 3 and 4, involving conversion to SG of lines to Robinvale and Sea
Lake, is dependent upon Commonwealth government funding.

### **V/Line: Additional trains**

Public Transport Victoria is currently undertaking consultation on the
timetable for the extra trains to Warrnambool, Shepparton and
Maryborough from **early 2017** as funded in the 2016/2017 State budget,
see <https://getinvolved.ptv.vic.gov.au/test-project19111> Both
Warrnambool and Shepparton trains would increase from three to four on
weekdays and from two to three on weekends. Maryborough weekday trains
would increase from one to two. There would effectively be a common
timetable to Warrnambool and Shepparton on both days of the weekend with
the proposed changes.

**Warrnambool**

* New 0905 up on weekdays, arriving Melbourne 1233
* New 1713 down on weekdays, arriving Warrnambool 2054
* 0550 up on Saturdays rescheduled to 0740, arriving Melbourne 1106
* 0725 up on Sundays rescheduled to 0740, arriving Melbourne 1106
* 0900 down on Sundays rescheduled to 0700, arriving Warrnambool 1046
* New 1130 up on Sundays, arriving Melbourne 1457
* New 1300 down on Sundays, arriving Warrnambool 1630.

It is not clear what would happen to the current Sunday afternoon return
bus between Warrnambool and Geelong, which is the only weekly service
stopping at Pirron Yallock.

**Shepparton**

* 1531 or 1631 down Seymour services on weekdays extended onto
Shepparton
* 0704 up on Saturdays and 0715 up on Sundays rescheduled to 0830,
arriving Melbourne at 1100
* New 1230 up on weekends, arriving Melbourne 1455
* 1605 up on Saturdays and 1705 on Sundays rescheduled to 1630,
arriving Melbourne at 1900
* 0930 down on Sundays rescheduled to 0912, as per Saturday
* New 1212 down on weekends, arriving Shepparton 1500

**Maryborough**

* 0917 weekday down Wendouree would instead travel to Maryborough,
arriving 1138
* 1552 weekday up Ballarat would originate at Maryborough at 1459.

### **Somerton freight hub**

DP [Dubai Ports] World Australia and Austrak plan to establish an
intermodal freight hub at Austrak’s business park at Somerton, 23 km
north of Melbourne, to be known as Somerton Rail Port. It is expected to
be fully customs bonded and to be connected by rail shuttle with the
Port of Melbourne.

### **Metro Trains Melbourne: Patronage**

Public Transport Victoria data shows that 51 out of 251 morning
peak-hour trains are packed above capacity, the highest level in six
years. Every second Craigieburn train in the morning was overcrowded
when an annual survey of each line was carried out in May. The
Cranbourne / Pakenham line, Melbourne’s busiest train route, was so
congested in the morning that 47% of commuters had to ride on an
overcrowded train. PTV’s data showed 37% of early Dandenong trains
carried too many passengers, up from 28% a year ago. On the Alamein,
Glen Waverley and Williamstown lines no morning trains were overcrowded.

### **Melbourne Metro tunnel**

Construction of Melbourne’s Metro Tunnel project commenced in late
September with early works in the CBD. John Holland, which holds the
\$324 million early works contract for the project, began work to move
up to 100 utility services under the city’s surface. The contract also
includes excavating the 11-storey deep shafts next to Swanston St to
enable the construction of the two new city stations.

### **Melbourne: Closure to remove Sunbury line level crossings 4-10
October**

An extended closure along the Sunbury/Bendigo line between Sunshine and
Sunbury from 4 until 30 October will occur so a pair of level crossings
can be removed and \$46 million in extra rail upkeep can take place.
Victoria’s Level Crossing Removal Authority will have roughly 700
construction workers working to lower the rail line below Main and
Furlong Roads in St Albans. St Albans and Ginifer stations will be
rebuilt, and redundant signals, tracks and overhead wiring will also be
removed. A consortium of CPB Contractors, Aurecon and Arcadis, which
also includes VicRoads, Public Transport Victoria and Metro Trains
Melbourne, is undertaking the level crossing removals and station
construction work. V/Line will also use the almost month-long stoppage
to undertake a \$46 million work program to replace sleepers and ballast
and to renew rail bridges along 380 kms of track to Bendigo and beyond.

Buses will replace Metro trains on the Sunbury line, and V/Line trains
on the Bendigo line, during the stoppage. The list of cancelled V/Line
trains during this period runs to ten pages of their amending “S”
circular.

### **Melbourne: More level crossings to go**

The Victorian Government has called for called for Expressions of
Interest for two new major packages of level crossing removals involving
11 more level crossings. These will be financed from the 50 year lease
of the Port of Melbourne on a 50-year lease announced on 19 September.
There will then be 37 level crossings removed or underway by 2018.

As part of the North-Western Package, Camp Road in Campbellfield and
Buckley Street in Essendon will be fast-tracked. Work will start next
year and both will be gone by 2019. The North-Western package also
includes the removal of level crossings at Glenroy Road in Glenroy, Bell
Street in Coburg, and Moreland Road in Brunswick.

Construction of the level crossing removal at Kororoit Creek Road in
Williamstown North and the partial duplication of the Altona Loop will
also begin next year, as part of the Western Package of crossing
removals, the pair said. The Western package also includes the removal
of crossings at Abbotts Road in Dandenong South, Aviation Road in
Laverton, Ferguson Street in Williamstown, and Cherry and Werribee
Streets in Werribee.

### **Melbourne: Frankston line**

The Down and Centre lines between Caulfield and Moorabbin were returned
to service from 1 August. The Up line was returned to service from 5
September. Peak express services have been restored following the
substantial completion of large-scale level crossing removal works.

### **Melbourne: South Yarra**

Fewer trains will stop at South Yarra if the \$11 billion Melbourne
Metro Tunnel project bypasses the area, Victorian government documents
show, and there will initially be longer waiting times for passengers
there. The rail tunnel design does not provide for a station at South
Yarra, diving below the surface just metres from the existing station
and re-emerging at South Kensington. The government's 2015 *Customer
Outcome and Economic Assessment Report* concedes that not building a
station at South Yarra as part of the project would reduce the number of
services, from a train every 75 seconds to every two minutes. The
government argues it would cost almost \$1 billion more to build a new
South Yarra station, and that the area is already superbly serviced by
public transport.

### **Adelaide Metro: Outer Harbor closure**

The Outer Harbor and Grange lines will be closed and replaced by buses
for about three weeks in January 2017 for major grade separation works
for about 3 km from Bowden to Croydon. This, combined with the underpass
under the ARTC line near North Adelaide, will provide nearly 4 km of new
line.

### **Aurizon: New traffic**

Aurizon has a five year contract with K & S Freighters to haul
approximately 20,000 containers per annum from Sydney to Perth.

Aurizon has secured its first coal haulage contract in the Southern
coalfields of NSW for the railing of 800,000 tonnes per annum from
Wollongong Coal’s Wongawilli Colliery to Port Kembla Coal Terminal.

### **South Australia: Mineral traffic**

SA intrastate operator, Genessee and Wyoming Australia, has, since early
July, been operating the following ore trains for Cu River Co. from
Rankin Dam on the north-south line:

                 **Wed**          **Fri**     **Sun**

Mineral wagons used on the former coal traffic from Leigh Creek to Port
Augusta have been sold to NSW based Consolidated Rail Leasing (a
subsidiary of Southern Shorthaul Railroad), for possible new traffics in
the eastern states.

**GSR: Alterations**

GSR states that from 14 September the schedule of the winter
ultra-touristy southbound **Ghan** is altered:

The new times for the Ghan are reflected in the ARTC Working Timetables
of 16 October, but not the altered times for the Indian Pacific.

### **TransPerth: Low-patronage stations**

The Public Transport Authority of WA is considering closing
“underperforming or inefficient” stations. “We need to consider the
impact of a train full of passengers pulling up at a low-boarding
station where often not a single passenger gets on or off,” PTA
spokesman David Hynes said. For example, typical weekday boardings at Mt
Lawley were 345 and were 524 at Meltham, compared to 1516 at Maylands
and 1833 at Bayswater. Mr Hynes said there were no immediate plans to
close any stations. He said the PTA monitored the performance of its
network, including population shifts, land-use plans, patronage
forecasts and the introduction of new services. “At the same time, we
are very conscious of providing high quality and responsive services
that best meet community needs,” he said. “We know that time is an
important factor for people when deciding whether to use public
transport versus the car.” He said stopping at a low-boarding station
added 90 seconds to the journey of passengers on the train “which, in
economic and personal terms, represents lost productivity and
opportunity”. He said this was particularly relevant on the older
Midland, Fremantle and Armadale lines where some stations were only a
few hundred metres apart. Mr Hynes said any decision to close a station
would require significant work and consultation with the community.

### **Pilbara railway**

A plan by Mineral Resources Ltd to build a “sky-rail” to transport iron
ore across the Pilbara has been given the green light by the WA
Environmental Protection Authority. The 330 km railway would run from
the Iron Valley project, north-west of Newman, to Port Hedland port. It
would cross more than 20 mining tenements, including rail lines owned by
Fortescue Metals Group, Roy Hill and BHP Billiton, four native title
claims, seven pastoral leases and Crown and state government-managed
land. It would be up to two metres above ground and some areas could be
more than six metres high.

"The benefits of the rail design is that it not only minimises the cut
and fill earthworks activities required during construction, but also
results in less disturbance to natural landscapes, such as surface water
features and fauna habitat, as well as infrastructure, such as existing
road and rail," MRL's website says. “An added advantage for the BOTS
rail structure is it is almost completely re-locatable once a
resource/reserve is completely exhausted."

MRL still requires approvals from several other regulatory authorities,
traditional owners and other tenure and pastoral lease holders before it
can commence construction.

Mineral Resources Limited is Australia's fifth largest iron ore
producer, exporting 10 million tonnes of iron ore in the 2014-15
financial year from sites at Yilgarn and Iron Valley.

### **Who operates what? New Zealand**

The May 2016 edition of our sister magazine, the *Times*, pages 11 to
16, contained an article entitled *Who Operates What*. That article was
an attempt to disentangle and explain the very complicated ownership and
control structure of 7Australian railways. The article covered
Infrastructure owners/controllers, passenger operators, and freight
operators. This item continues that article for New Zealand. NZ railways
are simple compared to Australia.

**Infrastructure**: Almost all public railway infrastructure is owned
and controlled by KiwiRail, a government entity. The only exception is
the tourist carrying Taieri Gorge Railway from near Wingatui (on the
South Island Main Trunk) to Middlemarch, which has been owned by Dunedin
City Council since 1990.

**Passenger operators:** The very few remaining long-distance passenger
trains in NZ (Northern Explorer, Capital Connection, Coastal Pacific and
Tranz Alpine) are operated by KiwiRail.

Auckland suburban trains (electrified network plus the Papakura Pukekohe
DMU shuttle) are operated by Transdev, formerly Veolia, formerly Connex.

Wellington suburban trains (electrified network plus diesel hauled
Wellington-Masterton trains), are since July 2016, also operated by
Transdev.

The significant tourist train operations from Dunedin are operated by
Dunedin Railways, daily on the Taieri Gorge Railway owned by Dunedin
City Council, and almost daily north to either Waitati, Palmerston or
Oamaru on a KiwiRail mainline.

**Freight operator:** All freight operation is by KiwiRail.

### **Sleeping in Europe**

With the annual European timetable change in December, DB German
Railways will withdraw most of its remaining overnight sleeper services.
However, most of these services will be picked up by ÖBB Austrian
Railways. ÖBB will market their existing and new sleeper services under
the name Nightjet.

# **BUS NEWS**

## **Australian Capital Territory**

The ACT government has revealed a new bus network that will deliver 80
new bus drivers and seven new rapid routes over the next four years. The
network, which goes head to head with a new rapid network drawn up by
the ACT Liberals in March, includes a rapid bus service running directly
from Belconnen to Gungahlin starting next year. Another will connect
Woden to the city via Barton. The existing blue rapid from Tuggeranong
to Belconnen is being extended to Lanyon in the south and Kippax in the
north. The government, like the Liberals, are promising to run a public
bus service to the airport. In 2020, two rapid buses will go directly to
the Canberra Airport – one from Belconnen via the city, and the other
from Lanyon, at the far end of the Tuggeranong Valley, Transport
Minister Meegan​ Fitzharris said.

The new routes will add \$26 million a year to the cost of the city's
buses when they're all in place in 2020. At the moment, buses cost about
\$120 million a year.

With the [Liberals releasing a plan for six new rapid bus routes in
March](http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/liberals-plan-action-overhaul-to-boost-public-transport-use-20160329-gntpvt.html),
the Labor and Liberal parties have made tit-for-tat announcements on
roads and buses. Both released "city loop" bus plans – the [government's
beginning its city
loop](http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/new-free-city-loop-bus-service-every-15-minutes-20160606-gpcu6x.html)
in July, and the [Liberals' are promising a wider city
loop](http://http:/www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/canberra-liberals-promise-their-own-city-loop-bus-service-that-takes-in-the-parliamentary-triangle-20160712-gq3vgt.html),
also heading to the Parliamentary Triangle.

Ms Fitzharris's bus changes are decisions that have been made and will
be incorporated in the coming budget update, rather than an election
promise. It costs the budget \$3.6 million in 2017-18 when two rapids
begin, then \$9.5 million the following year, with two new services,
\$16 million when another rapid is added in 2019, and \$26 million when
the final two are added in 2020. Ms Fitzharris said the new routes
incorporated the 1.2 million kms of bus travel each year that would be
freed up by the 12km light rail line from Gungahlin to the city. The
line will replace buses from Gungahlin to the city in 2018.

While both parties are promising more rapid services – which have fewer
stops and run every 15 minutes or more, Labor's plan differs from the
Liberals in the detail of the routes. The Liberals drew up their network
based on how people drive from centre to centre in Canberra – proposing
buses along the most direct car routes. But Ms Fitzharris said the
Liberals' idea that bus routes should follow car routes was flawed.
Instead, the city needed public transport corridors, she said.

Whereas the Liberals have proposed a direct bus route up the Tuggeranong
parkway, Ms Fitzharris said the parkway was too busy already to carry
more buses, Instead, the Labor's rapid service would travel along
Athllon Drive and through Mawson and the Woden town centre. The Liberals
also proposed a rapid service that looped into the city along Athllon
Drive and back to Tuggeranong via the Monaro Highway and Hume. But Labor
says the route is not justified by demand. The Liberals have proposed
one rapid to the airport, whereas Labor is planning two. Labor
[criticised the Liberals'
plan](http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/liberal-bus-plan-unaffordable-light-on-detail-act-government-20160330-gnupqg.htmlW)
when it was released, and raised doubts about the airport proposal,
given that the airport already has a privately contracted bus service
and the airport's agreement is needed for any public bus service there.
But Ms Fitzharris said the government would continue to talk with the
airport, which wanted to be sure that public buses would be as frequent
as its own service. "We will work with the airport over coming years to
negotiate the best outcome for an airport bus link. But this is our
plan, and the airport are open to it."

Ms Fitzharris said the debate about Canberra being a car-centric city
was over and she was already planning for more rapid bus routes into
Molonglo and Gungahlin beyond 2020 as the population grows. The rapid
buses were hugely popular, with more than four million passengers using
the blue rapid from Tuggeranong and Belconnen to the city, and more than
one million using the red rapid from Fyshwick and Gungahlin to the city
in the last 12 months, she said.

Labor's new network would mean 100 new jobs in all, including 80 new
drivers. It would include a new depot on the northside, probably in
Mitchell.

The ACT Liberals have proposed dedicated bus lanes along Northbourne
Avenue at a cost of \$58 million. If they win the ACT election on 15
October, they will change the tram contract to build these bus lanes
instead.

Independent Murrumbidgee electorate candidate (and ATA member) Brendan
Whyte, proposes an at-least half-hourly ACTION bus service between
Canberra airport and Civic, and if demand warrants, an extension or
separate service between the airport and Woden, to replace the current
private service which operates 12 weekday and 10 weekend services
between the city and airport, costs \$12 and does not accept Myway
cards. Dr Whyte also proposes increasing the number of locations
selling/reloading Myway cards to include all local suburban shopping
centres; removing the fare penalty for not tagging off in order to free
passengers from having to keep their Myway card to hand during the
journey and speed disembarkation.

## **New South Wales**

**Sydney Buses:** From 5 September some services in the Northbridge and
Castlecrag areas, and some routes that operate via Epping Road, Lane
Cove and the Pacific Highway which previously travelled into the CBD
will run to North Sydney or McMahons Point only. The changes aim to
reduce congestion by reducing the number of buses travelling into the
city during critical peak times. The following services will change:

-   [**Route
    254**](http://www.sydneybuses.info/routes/251_20160905_tt.pdf) will
    no longer run to the city. It will only operate between Riverview
    and McMahons Point.
-   Most **Route 290** services will be renumbered to **291** and only
    run to and from North Sydney and McMahons Point. Early morning and
    late night services on route 290 will continue to operate to and
    from the CBD.
-   **[Route
    203](http://www.sydneybuses.info/routes/202_20160905_tt.pdf)** will
    only run to and from North Sydney/Milsons Point.
-   [**Route
    202**](http://www.sydneybuses.info/routes/202_20160905_tt.pdf) will
    only run to and from North Sydney during weekday peak hours. At
    other times, services will continue to the city.
-   [**Route
    252**](http://www.sydneybuses.info/routes/251_20160905_tt.pdf) will
    only run to and from North Sydney during weekday peak hours. At
    other times, services will continue to the city. There will also be
    extra trips between North Sydney and Lane Cove West during the
    morning and afternoon shoulder peak periods.

Passengers on **routes 252, 254** or new **291** can transfer between
buses at Lane Cove Interchange, St Leonards or North Sydney to continue
into the city when direct services are not provided, or to trains at St
Leonards or North Sydney. Passengers on **routes 202** or **203** can
transfer between buses at Cammeray or North Sydney for the city or to
trains at North Sydney. There will also be an improved spacing of
services for customers travelling towards Lane Cove West along Burns Bay
Road.

There will also be minor timetable changes for

Due to Council roadworks in Macpherson St, Wariewood, routes 185, L85
and E85 will be temporarily diverted via Pittwater and Warriewood Roads
for approximately 12 months. A shuttle bus, Route 181 will operate to
and from Narrabeen via Warriewood Square, Macpherson and Garden Streets.

In early September, **Sydney Buses**, **Hunter Valley Buses** and
**Interline** uploaded new timetables. They were identical to the prior
editions except for Opal information and retained their original dates.

**Transdev** also re-uploaded all their regions 10 and 13 timetables to
their website still carrying the previous date, but they all carry a
note somewhere “Dated 1 August 2016”. This is possibly related to their
new Kingsgrove depot which opened in the week beginning 12 September, to
cover different wheelchair services etc as the result of roster changes.
The new depot covers local Hurstville routes 452, 453, 455 and 947 as
well as some Metrobus route M91 trips (instead of Menai), and some route
971 rosters which start and finish in Hurstville.

The fact that the region 1 timetables have also changed throws some
doubt on whether these changes were caused by the opening of the
Kingsgrove depot. Previously all trips were shown as route 577. Now some
deviations which previously did not show a different route number, are
now shown as route 577P. Routes 958 and 959 are also covered by the new
Kingsrove depot.

## **Queensland**

Translink is reviewing Toowoomba bus services. Public consultation
closes on 16 October. Coverage will be extended on proposed route 950
from Highfields Plaza to Crows Nest, and on proposed route 905 from USQ
to Westbrook. All route 902 and 907 services will be extended to
Glenvale and Wilsonton.

Translink is also reviewing bus services in Nambour.

## **Tasmania**

**Hobart:** Metro intended to extend the Tranmere bus service to the new
residential areas in January 2016 until it found that buses could not
safely access some extremely narrow roads. Clarence Council advertised
on 31 August a proposal by agents of the Infrastructure Division to
construct a bus turnaround complete with a bus shelter and drivers’
amenities on Oceana Drive south of the current terminus.

## **Victoria**

### **Footscray closes, Sunshine West opens**

A month after the historic Sandringham depot closed, another significant
milestone took place in the early hours of Monday 19 September, with the
gates on Transdev’s Footscray depot at 45 Buckley St locked for a final
time after 95 years. The depot has been replaced by a new facility on
Vella Drive in Sunshine West, which commenced operation later that
morning.

Footscray Depot served the local tramway system from September 1921
until its closure in February 1962, with the exception of the 82 Moonee
Ponds suburban route. The depot continued to serve the Melbourne and
Metropolitan Tramways bus service that succeed the tram routes, later
passing to the Metropolitan Transit Authority (1983), Met Bus (1993),
Melbourne Bus Link (1998) and Transdev (2013).

Like Sandringham Depot, Footscray Depot was sold to the Melbourne Bus
Link consortium in 1998 as part of the privatisation of Met Bus by the
Liberal State Government. The depot will now be redeveloped for a
supermarket and apartment complex, although it is currently available
for short-term lease as a transport depot.

MMTB government bus routes across Melbourne’s inner west operated from
the depot, with key routes including Deer Park West/Sunshine Park – City
(216/219), Sunshine – City (220), Highpoint – Yarraville (223),
Highpoint – Deer Park West (215), and from 20/11/1978 the 232 West Gate
Freeway City Express from Brooklyn (later Altona North). At night and on
weekends buses often substituted tram services on Routes 57 and 82 as
well as the outer end of the Upfield line. From 26/12/1936 to 9/121940
the MMTB also ran a Moonee Ponds – Footscray bus route along Smithfield
Rd, which forms today’s 404.

On 29/12/1993 the Sunshine – City services were through-routed to
Brighton and Gardenvale with the closure of Elwood Depot, and in 1999
buses reached the greenfields suburb of Caroline Springs. Buses later
ventured further north-west to Watergardens from 2007 until 2012 via
Route 460, now operated by Kastoria.

Rostering by Transdev in recent years saw the depot operate shifts on
the 903 Orbital SmartBus (from CDC’s Altona depot) along with select
trips in the Port Melbourne and Sandringham areas. Similar route
allocations continue to apply with the move to Sunshine West.

### **New Route 543 to Greenvale Gardens**

Tullamarine Bus Lines will introduce a new service to Melbourne’s outer
north on Sunday 16 October. Route 543 will operate between Roxburgh Park
and Greenvale Gardens, serving new estates west of Greenvale Reservoir.
The route parallels parts of their existing 484 service.

Buses will depart every 30-35 minutes at peak times and at 40 minute
intervals at other times, finishing around 2100, seven nights a week. A
round trip takes a minimum of 46 minutes (plus layovers), so two
vehicles will be required.

### **New Seymour Night Coach, Night Bus network patronage reports**

Following the recent announcement of a six-month extension to Night
Network until June, a fifth Night Coach corridor will be introduced on
Saturday October 15, with a 0200 departure to Seymour, serving all
V/Line stations along with coach stops in Wallan and Kilmore. The coach
will then continue to the Bridges Army Barracks in Puckapunyal on
request for those possessing a Defence Common Access Card (there is an
existing V/Line coach service on Sunday afternoons, plus Seymour Coaches
Route 3). With this additional route, all interurban V/Line stations
will now be served by either Night Coach or Night Bus.

Figures obtained by the Liberal State Opposition under FOI show the
Night Bus services are often running empty, despite overall weekend
Night Network figures now averaging around 35,000. Figures for the
morning of Saturday April 16 suggest just 13 touch-ons across the 21
routes between 0300 and 0400. Feeder routes 953 (Broadmeadows –
Craigieburn), 963 (Ringwood – Lilydale) and 981/982 (Dandenong –
Cranbourne) failed to register any boardings for the entire morning.
Anecdotal observations suggest Sunday morning loadings on Night Network
are stronger, so these reports may be slightly misleading.

Night Coach recorded passenger numbers of 8 or 9 Traralgon, and between
16 and 29 catching a service to Geelong, Bendigo or Ballarat.

### **Local Area Map updates for 709 extension**

New local area maps for the Greater Dandenong and Kingston
municipalities have appeared on the PTV website showing the recent
extension of 709 to Noble Park, but are dated October 2016 for unknown
reasons. Both maps still show the AM peak extension of 691 to Monash
University, discontinued almost five years ago in December 2011.

### **Casey Network start date**

Online timetables for various routes in Melbourne’s south-east are shown
with an end date of 12 November, suggesting the major network upgrade of
services across the City of Casey will commence on Sunday 13 November.
At the time of publication, details of the final network were yet to be
released. Public consultation on the changes took place during March and
April.

### **Woodend Flexiride begins**

PTV introduced regional Victoria’s second Flexiride service on Monday 3
October, operating in Woodend. Like the existing service in Yarrawonga,
passengers make a booking to be collected at one of 30 stops around the
local area to travel to Woodend Shopping Centre, and advise the driver
of their stop when heading home. The 490 bus in the Gowanbrae Estate in
Melbourne operates to a similar model but does not feature the Flexiride
branding.

Seven trips will operate on an irregular timetable between 0910 and 1625
on weekdays, with trips operated by Dysons Kyneton. Consultation had
suggested demand existed for services meeting commuter trains but these
are not provided at this stage. Paper tickets apply rather than myki.

It is interesting to note the service model differs to nearby towns. In
Kyneton, four fixed routes operate interpeak Wednesday to Friday only,
while in Gisborne both a fixed route and demand responsive service
(Gisbus) operate during peak hour only, meeting trains to/from
Melbourne, with bookings available for both fixed stops and residential
addresses.

### **Bendigo Route 60 changes**

Two routing changes took effect on Christians’ Route 60 (Bendigo – East
Bendigo) on 3 October. Buses will now travel via Beischer St instead of
Crook St while the loop at the East Bendigo terminus will revert to the
path the that former Route 9 took, along Victa Road past Bendigo
Airport.

## **Western Australia**

**TransPerth:** Changes to services 9 October 2016: The introduction of
new routes 384 960 and 970, withdrawal of routes 354, 870, 885 and 888
and the renumbering of 886, 887, 889 to 360, 361, 362 were outlined in
the proposals reported in the June 2016 *Table Talk*. Other changes are:

-   16 to Dianella now starts at Perth Busport rather than Elizabeth
    Quay Bus Station.
-   23 27 70 102 103 107 204 205 206 207 208 210 211 212 345 352 365 372
    376 385 386 388 389 465 517 518 519 undergo time changes.
-   24 25 and 28 have additional trips and 28 now starts at Perth
    Busport rather than East Perth.
-   41 42 48 55 60 66 67 68 undergo time changes and run as fully
    accessible services.
-   220 to Armadale now starts at Perth Busport rather than Elizabeth
    Quay Bus Station.
-   340 341 342 344 346 347 363 371 560 561 562 will run as fully
    accessible services.
-   343 377 378 379 undergo time changes and run as fully accessible
    services.
-   349 morning service starts at Benara Road after West Swan Road
    rather than Caversham Primary School.
-   450 Warwick-Landsdale extend into Corimbia Estate, Landsdale.
-   910 and 930 now run further west along St Georges Terrace before
    turning left into Mill St to terminate at Elizabeth Quay Bus
    Station.
-   950 will have additional afternoon peak and Sunday night trips.

# **FERRY NEWS**

Tasmanian Infrastructure Minister, Rene Hidding, advised the Hobart City
Council on 5 September that he will pursue the Council’s recommendation
to develop a plan to implement river based public transport. Such a plan
is required to reduce the volume of private car traffic on the main
trunk roads into the Hobart City CBD. The Council wants to bring ferry
stakeholders together for further discussions. It has been acknowledged
that infrastructure costs are high as jetties for fast ferries would be
required to be built in a number of suburbs such as, for example,
Kingston in the south, Glenorchy, Elwick, Berriedale and Claremont in
the north and Howrah, Bellerive and Lindisfarne in the east.

# **LETTERS TO THE EDITOR**

**Geoff Hassall** writes about **Newcastle** bus information: So much
for Government communication of timetable information! In the last NSW
State Budget, as reported in *Table Talk*, was an announcement of an
imminent extension of two of my local bus routes in Newcastle, 260/261.
No details were given, nor was there any information published locally,
so I asked my friendly local MP to look into it for me and the
community.

Two months later, my MP has received a reply from the Parliamentary
Secretary, not the Minister. The routes will be extended “during the
2016/17 financial year” (surprise, surprise) to “address changed travel
needs due to new residential development in the Minmi area”- no surprise
there either, as this is the only local area currently under
development.

The only slightly constructive information follows, suggesting that they
haven’t yet decided where the extensions are going to go yet anyway,
five months after announcing them! So why publicise them? To round it
all off, the Parliamentary Secretary attaches “for Mr Hassall’s
information” the media release that I/we got the information from in the
first place!

Moral: Don’t get too excited about announcements in State budgets!

**Craig Halsall** writes about **V/Line** bus timetable information:
After travelling through Lakes Entrance earlier this month on the
twice-weekly Canberra service, I decided I'd take a closer look at the
timetables for East Gippsland. It appears that between Dysons, V/Line
and PTV there has been a breakdown in communication with recent
timetable adjustments. I’ve discovered numerous discrepancies between
the V/Line Orbost timetable and PTV timetables for Routes 10, 11 and 12,
which I have listed below. Some departure times have shifted and some
trips now travel via Lake Tyres Beach. As the stops also have stop
timetables in both V/Line and PTV formats, there are presumably two
differing sets of departure times displayed at each stop as well!

**Sundays**

0550 ex Marlo (10) – correct\

1050 ex Marlo (10) – bus now departs at 1035 and travels via Lakes Tyers
Beach. Times up to Lakes Entrance are earlier\

1450 ex Orbost (ex Batemans Bay) - not shown on either Route 10 or
V/Line timetable\

1523 ex Lakes Entrance (11) – correct\

11:55 ex Bairnsdale (10) – correct\

14:00 ex Sale (10) – correct\

22:10 ex Bairnsdale (10) - bus now travels via Lake Tyers Beach (not
shown), times after Lakes Entrance need updating. It is not clear why
this trip is also shown on the 11 timetable as far as Lakes Entrance
when all other Route 10 trips via Lake Tyres Beach are not.

The Sapphire Coast Link coach serves towns from Orbost to Lakes Entrance
en route to Bairnsdale, but as noted above, these services are not shown
on either the V/Line Orbost timetable or the Route 10 timetable on the
PTV website. How many people are therefore unaware of these options?
There is only a marginal time saving made by these coaches skipping the
towns between Lakes Entrance and Bairnsdale and consideration should be
made to serve these stops.

Similarly, the twice-weekly “Capital Link” coach from Canberra serves
Orbost, Nowa Nowa and Lakes Entrance en route to Bairnsdale but skips
all other smaller townships, but again there is no mention in the Route
10 or V/Line Orbost timetables.

It should be noted coaches departing Bairnsdale for both Canberra and
the Sapphire Coast have pick-up only restrictions, as there are Orbost
coach services around the same time. Both services only appear to stop
at the Post Office in Lakes Entrance rather than all three coach stops
which may cause further confusion.

The Wednesday and Friday Route 12 return service from Gelantipy and
Buchan is also omitted from the Orbost/Lakes Entrance V/Line timetable,
presumably a legacy of originating as a fully commercial service by
Buchan Bus ‘n’ Freight in December 2003 before later becoming a subsided
service.

Residents of Lakes Tyres Beach may not be aware they should also consult
the Route 10 and 12 timetables for all services – a ‘related routes’
comment in the route description describes the common section with
Routes 10 and 12 as between Lakes Entrance & Bairnsdale.

At first glance there would appear to be little value in duplicating
information between the Orbost V/Line timetable and Route 10 and 11
intertown timetables, but the Orbost V/Line timetable fails to list
smaller stops in Toorloo Arm and Lucknow, as well as second stops in
Lake Tyres Beach and Swan Reach. There is also a stop shown at Lake
Bunga Beach Road only in the eastbound direction (not clear why this is
not shown westbound). It might make sense to include these stops to the
Orbost V/Line timetable?

In short, a person wishing to travel from East Gippsland to Bairnsdale
is currently required to consult the V/Line timetables for Orbost,
Sapphire Coast and Capital Link along with the Route 10, 11 and 12
timetables in order to work out all options available to them.

Coupled with the outdated timings on the Route 10 and 11 timetables,
travel around East Gippsland remains a complicated exercise. Showing the
full suite of services and stops on V/Line’s Orbost timetable would go
some way to simplifying timetable information to both existing and
perspective passengers.

# **ODD SPOT**

Is it a bus, a tram or a moving tunnel? The company building the world's
first "transit elevated bus" (tagged TEB-1) has conducted a test run
along 300m of roadway in the Chinese city of Qinhuangdao. The vehicle is
supported on guide rails either side of two traffic lanes and allows
cars up to 2.1m high to pass underneath. The test vehicle is 22m long,
7.8m wide and, with a single passenger deck, is 4.8m high. Passenger
capacity is estimated at 300 and a train of coupled units could operate.
It is claimed to be much cheaper than building a metro of similar
carrying capacity. Motive power is not stated. Clearly it is a rail
vehicle as it operates using a wide gauge guideway much like straddle
cranes at ports and container depots. There is no mention of
arrangements at road junctions nor how road vehicles over 2.1m high will
be excluded from its path.
